Jan,2015.0,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,Kinshasa,Toronto,"I know many people seem to recoil when I tell them I am flying on an African airline but I would fly Ethiopian Airlines anytime over any US airline. The service is top notch, the flight attendants, professional and attentive, and very patient with some very rude passengers. I have flown Ethiopian a number of times now and have seen a progressively improving level of service. Addis airport is a very efficient HUB through Africa. The flights within Africa are not as good (still better than most) than the flights to North America. Also, the fares are very reasonable and passengers aren't nickel-and-dimed to death which is now the norm in the US flights.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,AirlineQuality
Mar,2015.0,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,Nairobi,Addis Ababa,"Pretty horrible flight, with plane crowded and dirty. There were already transit passengers on board (from Burundi) when we boarded and the aircraft did not appear to have been cleaned. Took off around 30 minutes late with no explanation. Crew seemed disinterested and there was no inflight entertainment. The only positive point was that the meal was reasonably tasty and there was beer and wine on offer. The condition of the toilets was disgusting even at the start of the flight. Despite having a relatively good reputation, I will try my best to avoid using this airline again.",2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,AirlineQuality
May,2015.0,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,Nairobi,London,"At Nairobi airport, I was offered use of a small Kenya Airways lounge. Quite pleasant and adequate for a short wait. Boarding on time. Seats in the 737 were spacious and fairly comfortable. As there were only 5 business class passengers, I had an empty seat beside me. Food and service were good. Overall a pleasant flight. Addis Ababa airport was chaotic. A lot of people sitting around in corridors with mountains of hand luggage. The Ethiopian lounge was busy but I was able to get a seat. The seats looked good but were distinctly uncomfortable. No facilities for lying down or sleeping. Food and beverages were OK but not great. No showers and toilets not great. Wifi was available but very patchy in coverage and speed - staff were obviously aware of this as they warned me when I asked for the password. I was looking forward to the flight ADD-LHR as it was on one of Ethiopian's fairly new 787s. Boarding was fine. Business class layout was 2-2-2 but as there were few passengers, I could have an empty seats beside me. The seats were very disappointing and appeared to be an old design. They reclined to a relatively flat bed but it was angled and lumpy - not good for sleeping. Why Ethiopian would buy modern aircraft and fit them with inferior seats in their most profitable cabin is impossible to understand. Food was not good. I had beef which was tough and poorly seasoned. Other parts of the meal were similarly disappointing. In the business class cabin, there were 3 crew. One was dressed in a colourful uniform and was both pleasant and efficient. The other two were in drab outfits and had personalities to match. IFE worked OK but had a limited selection. The flight arrived on time. On arrival at LHR, my checked bag was not there. When I had checked it in at NBO, a large green tag reading ""transfer at ADD"" had been attached to it but, as I later found out, it had been left at Addis Ababa. Staff at the missing luggage counter at LHR were helpful and efficient but Ethiopian clearly were not. I arrived at LHR early on a Friday morning. It was not until nearly midnight on Saturday (and after numerous enquiries) that my bag was finally delivered to me in central London.",2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,AirlineQuality
May,2015.0,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,Mumbai,Cccra,"I flew Ethiopian Airlines as they are a part of Star Alliance. Flight from Mumbai which was scheduled at 5.30 AM took off near 7 AM. Missed my connecting flight to Accra. Was put up in Addis Ababa at a hotel with very limited menu for people who had missed connecting flights. Seems both the airline and the hotel were used to this problem, as my flight ticket for next day and hotel were already printed when I arrived at Addis Ababa. Food was just ok. Entertainment was good.",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,AirlineQuality
Jun,2015.0,serve other nationals better,Washington,Addis Ababa,"I flew Ethiopian Airlines from Washington to Addis Ababa. From the outset, the flight attendants were not even close to ""hospitable"". There were times that I needed a glass of water a number of times I was given a completely unwelcoming demeanor from the flight attendant that i talked to. It is a completely unfriendly vibe that you will find. I know about Ethiopian culture as I myself am an Ethiopian. We grew up being told serving others is inferior than being served and we tend to reflect that in all our dealings. What was painful was to see them serve other nationals better, even if we paid the same amount of money for the service. My return trip was better than my trip home. We were served Injera that I didn't find in my first trip and the attendants were also better.",1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

Smooth boarding at new LHR Term 2 compared to old T3. Flight time now only 7 hours. By far the best way to get to Addis. Addis airport efficient both ways. Do not like arriving at new LHR T2, massive long walks, baggage slow, not enough lifts from arrivals to public transportation.

Jun,2015.0,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,Bangkok,Nairobi,"Flew to Bangkok from Nairobi and return and I certainly did not enjoy the flight back. The Boeing 767's used from Bole International to Suvarnabhumi Airport and back are very old, felt like I was on a bus. The inflight entertainment is awful, variety of shows is poor, TV screen is unclear and the seats have signs of wear and tear. My flight from BKK to Bole was delayed by 3 hours which meant I missed my connecting flight, but that was sorted out once we landed in Addis. All in all, I would not recommend for long haul flights, however short haul flights are bearable.",2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,AirlineQuality
Jul,2015.0,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,Dublin,Los Angeles,"My family were traveling on Ethiopian Airlines for the first time. Unfortunately our experience was not very pleasant. We were traveling on July 27th 2015 from DUB-LAX. We arrived to find that our flight had been delayed, we had not been notified neither text, or email (which is standard by most airlines) nor did the ground staff have any idea of the length of delay. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 7.15am. Our flight crew showed up after 8.00am. Still my two excited children were excited about the trip ahead of them. We boarded the plane and found our seats. Then we waited and waited. We waited 30 minutes for the missing passengers to board. Unfortunately for 8 hours out of the 11 hour flight we had two children screaming and fighting with each other and kicking seats of other passengers. (Its not the airlines fault). We had one receptive flight attendant the whole time. She was delightful and did her best at trying to locate our pre-ordered meals. The other flight attendants seemed exhausted, by the end of the trip they just hit the back of a passengers chair if it was in full recline and would say ""move it up"" it just became comical. The inflight entertainment was scarce, the flight tracker was never reset as it stated we were departing from Addis Ababa not Dublin. By the time we landed in LAX there was no ""thank you for flying with us"" just ""bye"" as all the passengerd exited. One of my children had left a bag with toys under the seat in front of her. We did not discover this until we haf arrived at our accomdation. Simple fix right? Call the airline and airport. Wrong, 3 days of being put on hold, being transfered then being hung up on time after time. We finally got a number of a gate agent who said they would call us back (they never did) again we tried and someone told us to come to ""CBS"" one 1.5 hours later we got the bag back. Then only then someone asked us to fill out a missing bag report after we had tge bag in hand. Horrible experience.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality
Jul,2015.0,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,Los Angeles,Dublin,This is my first time on Ethiopian airlines and was impressed. The Route from LAX to Dublin is new and just started in June 2015. I was hesitant when booking but the fares were extremely good. The flight attendants were wonderful and I was impressed by their professionalism and concern for the passengers needs and comfort. The food and drink was very good. The plane being a new 787 Dreamliner was immaculate and this is the fastest flight I have had to Dublin. The direct route from LAX to DUB definitely filled a void since Aer Lingus pulled out several years ago. I would recommend this airline. The prices are reasonable and the service is fantastic. The hours of this flight are a little odd leaving LAX around midnight. The Dublin flight leaves for LAX at 6.15 am. If you can deal with those hours then this airline is the way to travel. No more flying 5 plus hours to the east coast laying over for hours and then having another 7 hour journey ahead. Our flight time was a little over 9 hours to Ireland.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,AirlineQuality
Jul,2015.0,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,Jeddah,Johannesburg,I boarded a flight from Jeddah to Addis Ababa connecting to Johannesburg. Due to the late arrival of the flight from Jeddah passengers connecting to Johannesburg where treated like cattle and rushed onto the connecting flight. My issued boarding pass with my pre-booked seats was changed. Our special meals was not provided or loaded on the craft. I am told that its a normal thing on Ethiopian airlines for luggage not to arrive. On arrival no luggage arrived in Johannesburg. I don't recommend this airline.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

I have nothing but compliments on the aircraft, cabin staff and the overall experience! Much better service on all four flights than on most domestic carriers and they were pleasant.

Aug,2015.0,never been treated so badly,Dubai,Addis Ababa,"I've just returned from a trip using Ethiopian Airlines. On the outbound journey they bumped us off one flight, bumped us off another then re routed us via Entebbe causing us to miss a whole day of activities whilst on tour in Rwanda. When we arrived it was to major disappointment our luggage didn't. The airline staff had no idea where our bags were and it took 2 days to locate them (one member ensuring us they were in Addis and would be arriving on the next flight, 6 flights arrived and still no luggage and one telling us they got takn off in Entebbe as there was no room on the plane due to other cargo). This ruined the start of our holiday as well as missing out on activities that we had pre paid for! The return leg was nothing more than a farce and absolute disgrace to the aviation industry! We were due to depart Kigali at 3.30 on Sep 29th, they hoarded the passengers to the gate where we were kept for over 4 hours as the screen kept displaying delay messages, no staff were present to request assistance from, nor was there access to any bathroom or water, we were hot and tired along with many other passengers. Eventually, around 6pm, we found out the flight was cancelled due to a cracked windscreen. This is not the ideal information to receive. Instead of handling the situation, their ground staff manager in Kigali airport was a disgrace and had no customer service skills. We were given no information and when asking for information or whether we could be rebooked she continued to shout at all the tired and upset passengers and treat us like dogs. We were herded round the back of the airport to collect our own bags and told to leave if we want - to go where?? Having arrived at the airport at 1.30pm and after a long tiring day we eventually were rebooked by 10.30pm, it took 9 hours and we were offered nothing! Not even a spoken apology came from the ground staff! We were rebooked at 2.30am on September 30th and had nowhere to go. We then had to go via Addis and Dubai and had approx another 24 hours of travelling till we'd reach our final destination. This meant taking extra days of vacation as we arrived back a day late. We were offered nothing by means of an apology, food or water just abuse by the Ethiopian Airlines ground staff. I've never been treated so badly in my life, my holiday was ruined due to their inability to provide the service I paid for and it was apparant they do not care about their passengers just making money by redirecting flights to collect more people (money) and refusing to rebook us with alternate airlines when cancelling our flight. I am appalled a so called customer service orientated company can treat human beings like this, yet alone paying customers! To make matters worse the planes were old, there was no entertainment on board, not even a shared TV screen and the seats were old and uncomfortable.",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality
Aug,2015.0,this is a flight worth considering,Kochi,Dar es Salaam,"As a Star alliance partner, Ethiopian Airlines share the domestic route with Air India from Kochi to Mumbai. My flight was from Mumbai to Addis and Addis to Dar es Salaam. Overall, I would say this is a flight worth considering. The quality of the flight is good and the service is also reasonably good. Inflight entertainment needs to be improved. A route from India (or any other country for that matter) should have more choices for the local people who travel that route. Except that it was a comfortable journey. Airport in Addis needs to be improved a lot. Addis to Dar flight was less crowded and food was not so great, but good.

Aug,2015.0,complete disregard to customers,Dulles,Cotonou,"After a first (and last) experience with Ethiopian Airlines, I will never recommend it. We booked a round trip to Benin and at destination on Sat Aug 15 in Cotonou, 3 of our bags were missing. We were told we would get them the following Monday. However, we didn't get our bags until Wednesday the 19th. Following this horrible experience, a representative of ET took care of us in Benin and did a great job. Unfortunately, we are back in the US today and none of our bags (4 of them) made it. This is unacceptable and a complete disregard to customers. The representatives at the airport just told us that we would get our luggage without any explanation, many other flyers were in the same situation in both Cotonou and Dulles. The bags had all priority tags on them and were still left behind. On a first flight with Ethiopian Airlines, we are completely discouraged by the service.",2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

Knowing the massive investment of Ethiopian in brand new B787 planes I expected also a good quality in the rest of the ET's fleet - I was completely wrong. The Business Class on B767-300 is at least 20 years old. Seats are with old mechanical controls and not working properly. In-flight entertainment is very poor and the screen's quality is very bad.

I have flown for the second time in one in business class, Bangkok-Addis Ababa return, and am totally disgusted. The plane is not only old (ashtray in lavatory !), but the seating is bad, narrow and not always working. There is no VOD. Overhead compartments are small. Food average, nothing to be proud of, with one of the dishes on the menu almost always missing. In contrast, the flight on a Boeing 777-300 from Addis Ababa was nice (good seat, good entertainment, same so-so food), but crew was nice in all cases.",3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,AirlineQuality

Aug,2015.0,Very nice plane,Washington DC,Addis Ababa International Economy,The plane was nice and the service was pretty good. The food was ok. One complaint I have is that they fed you and then left your trays on the tray table for over an hour after you finished.

Sep,2015.0,pay excess baggage for duty free,London,Lagos,"I was travelling Ethiopian Airlines to Lagos from London via Addis Ababa. I bought 2 bottles of perfume and 3 books with some chocolates at the duty free shops. When I got to the gate, I was shocked to meet a very hostile Ethiopian Airlines staff there who said I was now over my baggage allowance and I was told that I had to pay for excess luggage or miss my flight. He was very rude when I tried to explain myself to him. I had never experienced anything like that with any other airline before. What you buy at duty free shops airside shouldn't count as excess luggage, especially when it's not excessive. Otherwise why are the shops there? I had the receipts as proof that the items were bought there at the airport but he didn't want to hear anything I had to say. He shouted at me everytime I tried to explain. So I had no choice but to pay. Is this right for airlines to make passengers pay for excess baggage for duty free goods bought at the airport? I have given the ground service rating 1 star because there's nothing lower. They don't actually deserve any star at all. The cabin staff were good.",3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

After calling their office, I was informed this was not the case and that the flight will be leaving earlier (by 2 hours) than scheduled.

Fisrt a short flight to Paris and after a one hour stopover a longer flight to Addis Ababa, where you arrive early in the morning, which means that it can be very cold, since Addis Ababa is an altitude airport. Service on board is OK, but not much room for your legs. Waiting for a connecting flight at the Bole Airport is not comfortable, but it takes only 3 hours. The flight to Lilongwe nearly 4 hours.

Even if the plane was so old, the FAs did there best to make this flight comfortable and were helpful and friendly. A good hot meal and two times free drinks were served on this short flight. The meal was tasty. Plane arrived 20 minutes early in KUL. Flight in Economy was very cheap compared to Thai or Malaysia Airlines. Captain gave some flight information, nothing special to remember. All in all Ethiopian Airlines is for an african carrier very good, in their modern aircraft it must be a nice experience. I flew Ethiopian Airlines several times now, and never credited my mileage automatically - for frequent flyers not ideal, and you must credit the miles manually by contacting the costumer service of the airline - Ethiopian Airlines should improve that, it should be possible for a Star Alliance Carrier.",3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,AirlineQuality
Oct,2015.0,care for luggage is non existent,Bangkok,Cape Town,"I'm a frequent traveler between Bangkok and Cape Town (at least six times per year) and on my last trip (November 2015) I decided to use Ethiopian Airlines because their price was very competitive and it's an African airline, and I always try to support an African enterprise. This time my journey proved to be a mistake and, proved that you get what you pay for. Firstly, the planes were small and cramped - but I suppose this contributes to the low airfare. The departure lounges at Addis Ababa airport were shocking. Most of the info TVs were not working or showing other things apart from flight and departure info. The toilets were horrendous - wet floors, smelly, locks on doors broken, extremely aggressive staff, etc Thirdly and most importantly, Ethiopian Airlines does not take responsibility for your luggage. I had bought a Panasonic LED TV which I took back to Cape Town. At check in I asked for them to put on a Fragile sticker. I was told to take it to Oversize luggage and that they will put on the sticker. This I did and again I asked to for the sticker to be put on. They said they would. When changing planes at Addis Ababa my new seat was above the cargo hold of the plane and I saw them loading on my TV, without any sticker! I wasn't too concerned, as I thought they could quite easily see that it's a TV and would be careful. when I got home in Cape Town, I unpacked the TV only to find the screen had been cracked. I immediately phoned the Ethiopian Airlines call center and was told that I should send an email to Customer Relations explaining the problem. This I did, and I received an automated reply saying that they would get back to me within 10 working days - what a shocking time standard for an international company. After 12 working days I sent them a follow up email, and got a reply to say that the South African office will get in touch with me. On my return trip to Bangkok, I had still not heard from the South African office, so while I was at Cape Town International airport I tried to follow up on the matter only to be given the email address of the man in charge. Thirteen days later I had still not heard from the South African office, so again I sent an email. This time I got a rather prompt reply saying that they could not consider the claim because Ethiopian Airlines should not have accepted the TV when I checked in at Bangkok Airport, and I took too long to report the incident - even though all my correspondence (from day one) with them was attached to all emails. I'm sure I don't even need to highlight the stupidity of this kind of reasoning. Their lack of accountability and pathetic customer service leaves me more disappointed than angry. I certainly would not say don't use them. If budget is important then they're the best option, however bear in mind they you'll be dealing with a company where customer service is at an all time low and concern and care for your luggage is non existent.",1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,AirlineQuality
Oct,2015.0,I have mixed feelings,Paris,Johannesburg,"Paris CDG to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. I have mixed feelings about my flights: on the first trip, Boeing 787 airplane already looked ageing althought it cannot be old, FAs were robotic and didn't smile, food from CDG was bad and the breakfast was almost nothing (two biscuits). Return trip was better, with smiley and nice FAs on both flights, sligthly better food and better looking cabins. On the good side, seats were less cramped that I feared (and I'm tall), travel time CDG-JNB is convenient and of course price is competitive. The IFE is convenient but the choice of films and languages is limited, wine was awful and choice of alcool very limited. The FAs were sometimes rude and/or robotic. Addis Ababa airport is the worst part of the experience: awfully crowded, dirty and rather sad. Ethiopian Airlines has become a huge airline but the airport infrastructures have not followed and the result is clearly very negative.",2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,AirlineQuality
Oct,2015.0,it's not worth it,Addis Ababa,Manila,"I've flown Ethiopian within Africa on routes between several cities in Africa and flights have been pleasant. New fleet, cheerful and helpful flight attendants. This is a complete contrast to their flights into and out of the continent. Planes were very old with no inflight entertainment whatsoever. I could never get over the fact that the flight attendants are rude and unwilling to help. I'm not talking about them not smiling (I understand some cultures don't really smile). When several fellow passengers were asking for water or drinks they were ignored. One passenger was trying to call one of them, and he was ignored. When I asked if the flight was full and if it was possible for me to change seats (I was seated next to a very obnoxious passenger), the flight attendant just said ""if you can find an empty seat go ahead."" Besides that, it takes them way too long to serve food and get the food trays after eating. Some passengers put their trays on the floor creating a mess and it took them too long to clean it, even though they could clearly see the mess those passengers were making.

Why not give everyone a bottle as most airlines do on over night flights? The lights were turned off/on and on/off so many times, and it was hard to get sleep when they're doing this frequently. A let down for Ethiopian hospitality which was otherwise so good.

You are unable to check in online in the UK. The transfer service at Heathrow is terrible where the desk only opens 2 hours before departure. The IT system at Heathrow is almost non existent, and you are unable to upgrade, and bookings, even adding your Star Alliance Gold Card don't work. Boarding the plane is a shambles. Amazingly even the new aircraft look tired and shabby. The onboard toilets are filthy and often there are no hand towels. The staff appear poorly trained. The choice of drinks is limited and poor quality and food is normally poor. My luggage gets lost about 1 in 3 of all flights on Ethiopian. Luggage tracing is non existent. The Bole Airport experience is pretty poor, aggressive customs, shambolic Visa on Arrival, rip off taxi drivers. I used to fly business class but it is simply not worth it.

I have had many shorter flights within the USA that were far more unpleasant than my 18 hour flight to Africa. Again, the flight attendants were nice, attentive.

Boeing 787s already look worn and on most planes, the touch screen IFEs do not work well. During the late evening rush hour, flights get delayed. Ethiopian Airlines does not offer a choice of meal on its Addis-Europe flights, hence you only get a hot snack on the 5.30 hour flight between Addis and Rome.

The airline would allow me to carry three duty free bottles of alcohol that I had bought onboard the plane, one I had bought in Addis Ababa and the others in Johannesburg, in an airport secure bag used for transit, I was forced to check them on with cargo and all smashed of course when I collected at the other end. The staff were rude and unhelpful and could not give an explanation as to why I could not carry these - I've travelled a lot and never had this issue.

However, despite repeated reminders to the attendant at the booking counter, this time however we were not provided with a baby cot / aisle seat. My 10 month old daughter was restless almost the whole flight and at times it became very difficult to attend her. What shocked me was they allot aisle seats to kids who are 4/5 yrs old but not for infants and that as well despite repeated reminders to the booking staff. After a 2 hour halt, had a connecting flight to Mumbai from Addis Ababa at 11 pm local time. Again a nightmare, this time in terms of the flight. How can they think of operating a Boeing 737 to Mumbai for a 5 hour flight? Completely cramped flight, no option to even move your hand, forget reclining the seats. Veg Meal was the worse that I have had with any airline. Only plus sign was again they served drinks as often as we wanted. Veg food was an insult, sweet rice and sweet chick pea curry.

Cabin crew on all legs were excellent - very friendly, polite and professional. They all made a real effort, and seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Food was plentiful and good - a reasonable selection of dishes to choose from, as well as cheese and desserts; likewise, a good selection of alcohol was offered.

I was so surprised to only see a few Irish people on board making use of this excellent connection. I hope Ireland utilizes this more so they keep the route open. My return ticket was only $750 and it leaves Los Angeles at around midnight and lands around 6pm so it really helps with jet lag so you don't need to wait around all day like a zombie before going to sleep. The cabin crew were really nice, helpful and happy to be there. The airplane is the new boeing dreamliner. It's so quiet, the air is not as dry and the entertainment system was great.

The food is basic, no choice - chicken in tomato with pasta, on both legs, plus a continental breakfast. The flights were only half full, which made them much more pleasant. The Boeing 787 was quite new and a lovely aircraft. The landing in Dublin was tricky, with stormy conditions, but we got in safely.

We were taken to a lounge and given some rice and curry chicken. At 2AM we still had no information, and no boarding passes. After harassing the staff, we were told that ""due to the weather"", we would have to spend the night in Addis and leave at 10AM. We had to wait for hotel vouchers, which were given to us at 4AM. Total waiting time from the scheduled departure time to getting hotel vouchers was 5 hours! The next day, the 10AM flight was delayed by 1 hour for operational reasons. Good side: we were taken to a nice hotel with clean rooms and bathroom (no hot water in bathrooms with a 12°C temperature outside), and were served breakfast before being taken to the airport at 8AM.

The seats on the 787 are comfortable enough but if the airline does not take care, in a few months the electronics may fall apart.

Flight was half empty so I got myself 3-seats together (as did all of the last section of the economy cabin). Flight departed and left around on time. A fair number of unruly and loud children on the flight, but that seems to be a standard on long-haul flights to Africa. Addis to Entebbe was good, including a full meal on a 2 hours flight.

To give you an idea of how old this plane was the safety video showed a Walkman (yes portable cassette player) as an example of electronic devices. Seat leg room is shorter than normal, I'd say 30-31 inches at best. Seats are uncomfortable, the cushions are not well attached and will slide around so you are almost sitting on the seat frame. In flight entertainment consisted of 5 or 6 movies playing on a loop, the screens are very small and picture quality is not good, sound is distorted. Food was poor. Flight attendants spent most of the time in the back and did not walk through with beverages after the normal meal service and did not respond to call button. On all landings (4 on this trip) people started getting up as soon as the wheels touched the ground and the flight attendants sat and watched without saying a thing. Manila to Bangkok the flight was almost empty, but Bangkok to Addis was very full. This airline owns 5 or 6 Boeing 787s which they use for shorter, lower traffic flights within Africa.

Feb,2016.0,last time flying them,London,Harare,"I flew for the first time on Ethiopian Airlines from London Heathrow to Addis Ababa to Harare in Feb 2016. Unbelievable screw ups! My luggage didn’t arrive and was held in Addis (despite an 8 hr layover!). It came 2 days later even though there are daily flights to Harare. Worse yet, ET completely cancelled my return sector from Harare to Addis (ET 873) without any notice (my email is in the booking file). I only found out by coincidence on checking my booking online. As it was a Sunday and the main city office was closed, I went to the airport to reinstate this sector. Nothing could be done. Go the city office tomorrow, I was told. So, I did and ET office staff first told me my scheduled flight (ET 873) was cancelled. They asked if I could travel a day earlier (and wait 24 hr in Addis for my connecting flight to London-Heathrow). Then, I was told ET 873 wasn’t cancelled after all, and I was given a print-out confirming my flight and a seat on ET 873. Then, trying to check in online, I read a note on my file that there was still a problem with the Harare-Addis sector and I should see the counter check in agent. At airport check-in, I’m told the ET office printout showed a booking in V class but their computer shows U class. (How is that even possible on a single booking?) Even though my original itinerary showed U class, and U is higher than V class, they would not check me in. I waited 45+ minutes for the office and airport staff to correct their problem before being issued a boarding pass. It doesn’t end there. On arrival in London Heathrow (ET 700), I noticed that my previously confirmed aisle seat is now a window seat on my Air Canada (AC 851) flight to Calgary. How can ET even change a confirmed seat on AC when AC couldn’t assign a seat for me on ET prior to my departure? Ethiopian Airlines don’t belong in the Star Alliance.

Feb,2016.0,Great airline spoilt by its home base,Johannesburg,Brussels International Economy,"From a personal viewpoint, I have found Ethiopian Airways a great pleasure to fly. When there are problems they are quickly attended to and resolved. Case in point I flew to Brussels when the airport was closed after this years terrorist incident. Our flight was stopped and Brussels and buses were provided to transport passengers on to Brussels and back from Brussels. This was clearly stated on the website but on checking with local booking agent and local sales office, no-one could confirm this, even though it was clearly stated on website. As a result I made my own onward travel arrangements but found buses all running each way as stated on the website. On registering my complaint about ground level information, I was immediately sent a sincere apology and a whole bunch of air miles were credited to my account. Great customer service. Last year I flew to Shanghai and our plane back had technical issues. Ethiopian immediately arranged local accommodation although it was not communicated very well by the Shanghai ground staff. We flew the next day and I missed my onward connect to JNB. No problem - we were whisked off once more to a local hotel in Addis for 6 hours and caught the next connection. Ethiopian aircraft are new, appear to be well maintained, staff are efficient and polite, airfares generally very well priced but the downside is always the layover in Addis Ababa. What a dump the airport is and the facilities are shocking - good news however is that they have started upgrading the airport so those long layovers may become a little more bearable.

Mar,2016.0,quality is not up there,Dublin,Los Angeles,"I flew with the carrier for the first time in March 2016, from Dublin to Los Angeles. I am a frequent flyer, and have at some stage used most of the main international carriers, and this is the first time I have ever felt the need to go to the trouble of writing a poor review for an airline. The outbound flight was rescheduled at the last minute, meaning I arrived just over an hour late to LAX. Subsequently I missed the connecting flight which was Alaska Airlines. They told us to contact Ethiopian, who should have checked us in all the way to our final destination at Dublin airport but had refused to do so. We spent an our on the phone to Ethiopian customer services, as they had no representation at all at LAX. The person dealing with us on the phone was incredibly rude. Eventually he agreed that Ethiopian would pay for and book us on another flight, we were instructed to go back to Alaska Airlines. When we discussed what we were told with them, they said the method suggested was impossible. Luckily Alaska airline were extremely helpful and gave us change of seat fare instead of full fare, on the next flight available, which was actually from Orange County airport the next day, which cost us shuttle bus and hotel. As for the flights themselves, our screens did not work in either outbound or return flight and the crew seemed to think this was normal on a 10 hour flight. I had to clean the toilet on my flight home to use it, as every toilet on the aircraft after 4 hours into the flight was dirty. I am the least fussy eater but I can say the food was not even recognisable for some meals, I suggest bringing your own snacks. Finally the most concerning point, when waiting to leave LA, there was some kind of technical trouble, so we sat on the aircraft for two hours before leaving, late again of course. The problem was, before leaving we received no safety demo. None of the crew came around to inspect the cabin configuration for take off, my friend was fast asleep with her seat reclined as we started to head down runway. Ethiopian Airlines is the first airline I have ruled out so far. The flights were more expensive than other carriers but the quality is not up there with the big carriers I'm afraid.

Although we had a 7hr lay-over at ADD on the return, the airport unusually has comfortable beds in the transit area to lie on and reasonably priced freshly cooked refreshments (even at 01.00hrs) and drinks in various cafes. It was certainly more comfortable than the lay-over at Dubai airport last year. Warning: - do not buy any form of liquids - water, alcohol, or perfumes at the Addis Ababa duty free. Even when sealed and in an official duty-free bag it will be confiscated at an extra security check just before the departure gate.",4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,AirlineQuality
Mar,2016.0,price fantastic for us,Johannesburg,Dublin,"Ethiopian Airlines price was fantastic for us as pensioners, £320 return from Dublin to Johannesburg, so we were willing to put up with a little discomfort, but were impressed with most things. Addis Ababa is not the world's idea of a great airport and the ground staff there were most unhelpful and far from organised. It was only a 2hr 25m stopover, as we waited for our connecting flight to Dublin. The announcement, over an antiquated address system, was called as a Canadian flight and via Dublin was never mentioned, caught it by the skin of our teeth. Ground staff at Johannesburg were great and could not have been more helpful. We had 3 seats each from Johannesburg to Addis to relax on for the 4.5hr flight, food acceptable and no worse than other airlines. The planes look well used and a lot of the seat screens did not work. Cabin crew vary from inexperienced to most helpful and just the luck of the draw. If you are a reasonably experienced flight passenger and want value for money go for it. Total journey time on this flight is 16hr 25m each way.",3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

Mar,2016.0,Good flight from Nairobi to Addis Ababa.,Nairobi,Addis Ababa Africa Business Class,I don't ever recall flying with Ethiopian Airlines before so this short hop from Nairobi to Addis Ababa was a new experience for me. I have to say that it didn't start so well. My attempt to get my local colleague to join me for a pre-flight drink in the Lufthansa/Star Alliance lounge failed. I needed to have Senator status to invite one guest to join me. So we skipped that... The late afternoon flight itself was relatively troublefree. The few seats in business class were comfortable enough with ample leg room and I could enjoy a drink with a snack. We took off on time and arrived punctually which was just as well as we had a dinner appointment later that evening. I certainly have no hesitation in flying with Ethiopian Airlines again which I plan to do in October.,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,TripAdvisor

Apr,2016.0,need to up their game,Los Angeles,Dublin,"First time flying Ethiopian and was excited to fly them as I had heard they were good, one of the best in Africa. Boarded at around 11.30pm in LAX, didn't take off until nearly 2am (I had heard they were often late, which seems to be true on so many occasions - looked at a popular flight tracking website and most if not all their past flights were 1-2 hours or more late). When we finally left LAX, the cabin crew started at the back of economy delivering meals. They reached my seat (front of last economy section) at around 3am. I was handed the tray with ""here's chicken"", the crew couldn't have been less bothered, no smiles (except from purser when we stepped aboard) and a general look of being completely fed up. The ""meal"" (using that term very loosely) was absolutely the worst I have eaten on board an aircraft. The tray, food containers and servings were tiny. Rock hard bread bun and a slimy square of something resembling a muffin/desert bread. Measly pieces of chicken in a runny gravy with two tiny boiled potatoes and a piece of broccoli. The crew took so long to collect trays that people started to leave them on the floor by the bulk-head / door. At around 4.30am they were picked up and lights were left on full brightness in the cabin until maybe 5am. My armrest TV was broken as were maybe half of the TV screens in the cabin (this was a relatively new B787-8 aircraft). Toilets were in poor shape for most of the flight. When we arrived in Dublin, we waited at the carousel for bags to be delivered for close to an hour and a half. Tweeted Dublin Airport Authority to ask what was going on and they replied that it was the airline's fault. Reading another review on here, I feel lucky that we got our bags at all. Return flight to LAX two weeks later was better because the flight was maybe a third full and entertainment system was working. However, Food was still pathetic and we left Dublin an hour late. First and last trip ever with Ethiopian. They need to up their game. What a waste to have a fleet of new B787-8 aircraft only to provide such terrible service.",3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

We did not get our things until April 11th - 5 days from when we flew. We had no shoes, accessories, tuxedo, gown, make up, hair care, etc. We called and called. Never did anyone respond. We purchased our tickets in advance, paying over $1100 each. I should be reimbursed for all of the items we had to purchase. We attended 6 events while on the trip, had to miss the first one as we didn't have the items we needed to look presentable. We saved for a long time to go on the trip. I shouldn't have had to spend additional money on things I already own - flat iron, clothing, shoes, make up, etc. Not once had Ethiopian Airlines returned a call or email.

I fly Ethiopian regularly within Africa as they have so many connections and used the Dublin route to attend a university graduation reunion. The airline uses the 787 Dreamliner on the Addis-Dublin route which then travels onto the USA and back. The aircraft is a dream to fly on as it's spacious and quiet. I was able to secure an emergency exit seat with maximum leg space on both flight legs. As always, staff and in-flight services are very good quality. If I have any faults with ET they are the limited seating and hospitality services at Bole Airport in Addis, sometimes long Qs at the final security checks at peak flight dispatch times and on-board food (especially that awful tasting chicken that's the only dish on short-haul flights). Economy food could be improved (Emirates sets the benchmark here). All-in-all, a great airline to fly with to and from Africa and within, and thus highly recommended.

May,2016.0,A credit to African airlines,Tel Aviv,Johannesburg International Economy,"I regularly fly Ethiopian as a cheap and easy way to travel in and out of Africa. Over the past few years, I have seen their service and planes steadily improving. The aircraft cabins are in good condition: clean and comfortable. (Okay, sometimes it's not great if a very large person is seated next to you, but that's the same with all airlines!) I find the staff at check-in to be efficient and helpful, and the cabin crew are wonderful - always happy to assist with anything you need. The only negative is flying through their hub in Addis Ababa; this has been difficult for years with a sub-standard transit area. Fortunately, a major upgrade of the airport buildings is currently under way, and Bole Airport should soon be an easy transit to the next leg of your journey. On-board entertainment is good, particularly when on one of the bigger planes that have personal screens and a wide variety of TV, movies, games, etc. to keep one occupied. And finally, the food is above-average; considering the difficulties with serving that many meals from tiny cabins, they do an amazing job. I have never had a bad meal. If you have visions of an African airline having goats running up and down the aisles, think again! This is a modern, top-class airline!! P.S. And don't forget that you will often be flying over beautiful Africa and can catch glimpses of Kilimanjaro or the Great Rift Valley and its lakes, among other treats!",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

The in flight movies were fine and food/beverage service was above average. The flight attendants were very efficient and courteous. ET share the business class lounge at Dulles with Lufthansa - it was very nice. The Addis Ababa terminal is a dump. We waited the scheduled three hours for our connecting flight. The ""business class"" lounge was just a small area in the general terminal with a red velvet rope surrounding it. They provided bottled water and a personal escort to the bus delivering you to the aircraft, but that was about it. The first chair my wife sat in had only 3 legs and she had to move. The B737 for our connecting flight to Cape Town was fine. The business class seats were comparable to first class domestic in the USA. Again we had good food and service from the flight crew.

Otherwise you should go for chicken and rice. The big drawback that will prevent me to take any Ethiopian flights in the future is the fact that this airline is not integrated in the Star Alliance system for mileage credit. To make it short: I flew in business from IAD to NBO via ADD and return and I got....zero miles.

I missed it by a few hours and lost the booking. They could not re-book at the airline office REALLY! I had to go home and re-book. Refused to issue a ticket again went back to airline office after two more hours finally got a ticket.

The plane was very spacious and legroom is the best I have experienced on transatlantic flights. I found the food very good with a great choice of meals offered and being able to have a 'free' wine (or two) with dinner a nice touch. In October 2015 Ethiopian Airlines was the only airline offering direct flights from Los Angeles to Dublin and although Aer Lingus started operating a direct flight in May 2016, I found that ticket prices for Ethiopian Airlines were almost half the price of Aer Lingus flights for the dates I was looking for. Also on the return flight from Dublin to Los Angeles in October 2015 that although we were told on check-in that there was going to be up to an eight hour delay in departing, all customers were looked after very quickly and very efficiently by friendly staff and within half an hour, we were being taken to a nearby 4* Hotel, treated to full breakfast and lunch in the hotel before being picked up and brought back late afternoon for departure - that to me is proof that Ethiopian Airlines knows how to look after their customers.

They provided camping mats and thin blankets for us to sleep on the floor of the terminal. We missed all our connecting flights and needed a way to get to BFN in time to attend a meeting. Trying to get information out of anyone in order to get our bags and cancel our tickets was impossible even with the help of the Heathrow Information people (who were extremely nice, and tried to be helpful as possible), and other airport staff getting involved.

Jun,2016.0,better than expected,London,Cape Town Central International Economy,"so i decided to use Ethiopian Airlines to fly from LHR to CPT primarily because it was by far the best option for me in terms of length of flight, cost of a one way ticket and the fact that I got 2x23kg bags at no extra cost. check in at London was a bit of a nightmare, thought this isn't really the fault of the airline as you check in used is for all the star alliance partners. yes i was slightly over the hand luggage allowance (my fault I know but when your moving overseas and carry expensive camera gear theres not alot you can do about it) but rather than the check in staff being snotty and suggesting that I move stuff over the checked luggage (which couldn't do due to the nature of what i was carrying) they could have just mentioned at the time of check in that if I kept it at the level it was at that i may have to pay a small amount extra per kilo for the overidge rather than me trying to move a couple of bits over and not having it make much of a difference. - something i would have happily done to not have the stress at the airport. anyway back to the airline. we were late leaving London by at least a 60 min but i doubt that this was there fault. the cabin crew were great and served drinks whilst we waited (something I've never had an airline do). i also like the fact that when we got to AA the airport staff showed all the transfer passengers a short cut to the departure lounge. there wasn't a bad choice of movies, made up of some block busters some classics and a mixture of Asian/African films ect. there was plenty to keep me amused. the first leg to Adidas abba I had my own tv and the second half it was the over head screens with two newish films showing. the food was like any normal airline food. i did order a gluten free meal and didn't find it spicy at all. the only down fall with the gf meals was the snacks as they were just normal snacks served to everyone else. as i was stuffed from the food it didn't bother me missing out on these. they may have has some gf free bits in the kitchen for me but as i wasn't fussed about it i didn't bother asking. the flight did involve touching down in Botswana but that was only for a quick refuel/to let people off the flight and we were back in the air fairly quickly. as this was by far one of the lowest costing airlines i wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. its not expensive and people that want a top of the line experience should be prepared to pay more.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

After travelling from Frankfurt to Mahe and back, I can say that I never will choose a flight again with this airline. - Very bad service: Flight attandents work totally uncoordinated and have no idea how service should look like - Equipment/Food: The equipment was very bad. They served coffee in a plastic glass, cannot offer any milk to it (only unhealthy creamer), inflight entertainment was bad and did not work (also on their new aircraft 777/787), the food was outrageous and not enjoyable, very cheap headphones which hurt your ears... - Addis Ababa: Very dirty airport, bad shops, no proper working wifi, super chaotic security service and therefore all flights have not been on time - Airplanes: It seems like they offering great fares on new airplanes but once you need to connect in Addis to another destination in a ""smaller"" plane, you will sit in one of the odelst models you can imagine - Baggage: After arriving in in Frankfurt my suitcase has been lost now for a few days. There is actually no reaction or support from Ethiopian Airlines in finding my suitcase or even to inform me where my suitcase is located at the moment. There wasn't even a ""Sorry sir for this inconvenience"", the entire staff just seems extremely bored and do not intend to help you with anything.

There were mosquitoes, the waiting areas were so crowded and was so closer to chaotic due to traffic of people. The Intercom wasn't working so some guy would belt out announcements on some loud speaker which was so loud and inaudible again. you would hardly hear the instruction. There is hardly an wi-fi should you want to just connect and update your communication. The toilets are so dirty and horrible, you hardly can sit in there. When finally there was a boarding call, people stampeded to the boarding gates as though we were rushing for a random bus with some exclaiming their bad experiences after some alleged overbooking with the airline and they were asked to wait for the next flight or something.

Jul,2016.0,I love them,Frankfurt,Nairobi International Economy,"I read all sorts of bad reviews about this airline, don't believe them. I just did 12 flights on my trip and 9 of them were on Ethiopia Air. one on Air Canada, one on South African air, and one on Lufthansa. Ethiopia Air puts Air Canada to shame and the worst of all the flights was Lufthansa. Ethiopia air over feeds you, and don't stop going around with the drink cart, all for free, no matter how long the flight is. Air Canada charges for everything, and I'm Canadian but never seen such good service on an airline like Ethopian air. I thought the food was awesome, and one of my flights was only a little over an hour, and yup there they go with the food and drink cart, and went around twice in an hour flight to serve you drinks. I am just really amazed, because you get nothing on an Air Canada flight, and if you do want a bite to eat they over charge you 4 times for a bag of chips or a sandwich, and a price of a drink is outrageous. all my flights with Ethiopian air, pillow and blanket on my seat, again you want a blanket and a pillow you have to pay for it with Air Canada. I really was expecting a horrible airline based on the reviews, and to those people who left them, I want to say you need to fly with Air Canada more regularly and you will love Ethiopian Air. I had several 2 hour lay overs in Addis abba, out of 9 of the flights, 1 was delayed, and still made every connection. and that flight that was delayed they launched their new air bus, and the prime minister of Ethiopia was on the flight. ( I didn't get to see him, but i'm sure the delay had something to do with that). Completely recommend this airline. some of the shorter flights I did the flight attendants look a little tired, but again tired I can handle, Air Canada flight attendants are mainly just rude. I fly a lot, and love Canada, but Air Canada is just an airline, expect nothing and ask for nothing and you will be fine, like taking a bus ride. But I expected nothing from Ethiopian Air based on the reviews here, and flew with them on 9 flights, so it wasn't just a random good flight. I love them, I'd fly with them anytime, food and service was great. Also was expecting a bunch of screaming children running around the air plane based on previous reviews, there was nothing like that. The only screaming children and really really bad service and bad flight was on Lufthansa flight. Also would like to say, South African air is a great airline also. Only flew from Cape Town to Jo berg, but wow again out with food and drink for a one hour flight. Totally recommend them. I have been to about 35 countries, and am not rich so do things as cheap as possible, traveled on many airlines, but this was my first time in Africa. I read lots of reviews trying to prepare myself, and I can say all of the reviews about Ethiopian Air weren't good. So i was prepared for ""travel"" and nothing more. They are the best airline I have ever been on. Maybe it was because i was prepared for the worst, but my flight from Frankfurt into Nairobi I had the best meal ever on an airline. I was shocked this was the first of my 9 flights with them. I kept waiting for the horrible experience with them, and never had it. I don't fly first class, so have no idea if the first class is a shocking horrible experience compared to other airlines, but I do know that they deserve a good review. This is just my opinion, I read a lot of reviews while preparing for trips, so i have an idea of what to expect, the reviews of this airline was not my experience at all.

Jul,2016.0,Budget but good airline,Addis Ababa,Cape Town Central Africa Economy,"My third flight with Ethiopian this year and the last leg of my journey. A very definite reason that I fly Ethiopian is that it affords me to visit Addis Ababa at no charge and to visit colleagues and to offer them training in martial arts. Its just getting the booking right for a long stay which then includes the free hotel accommodation with meals. That is a real bonus as it also allows me to see a bit more of the City every time I visit and to learn more of the culture, etc. The plane's itself is nothing to write about - good and safe with terrible in-flight entertainment, so bring along your own tablet for movies', etc. Two of the flights on this journey had the drop down TV and the other two on the seat in front, but the controls to chose and select is a real pain. Unfortunately my laptop battery only lasts so long. I wish they could install the power supply under the seats like some other airlines. Meals are ok and the staff generally helpful. Flying over Tanzania, the pilot gave a running commentary about Kilimanjaro which was well appreciated. With the flight relatively empty, passengers could go to the side and look through the windows. Getting assistance at the airport is a breeze. The only thing that is not cool is the disorganised boarding process (only at Addis Ababa) and the queue's in having to go through the security checkpoint from the departure terminal. The terminal is normally crowded so a few extra seats and better toilets will be a plus. They could do with some better organisation there. Despite the poor entertainment, and the bit of downside at the airport, I will certainly fly with them just for a chance of seeing more of Addis.",2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Especially the food was disappointing, especially for me who is lactose intolerant. When we arrived at our final destination, Entebbe, our luggage was missing. To make a long story short: We still don't know what caused the luggage to go missing, but the total lack of service from Ethiopian when we tried to get some updates on where our luggage was was just horrible. We received our luggage 5 days after we arrived had had NO follow-up on the luggage, we had to do all digging ourselves. Our return flight from Addis to Stockholm was horrible. We got delayed by 3/4 hours due to a technical issue. These things happen, but the total lack ofinformation was frustrating. We arrived in Stockholm about 3 hours late and missed our connecting flight to Oslo. Although Ethiopian knew about the delay since 12 am, they had not fixed us a new flight when we arrived in Stockholm at 12 pm. There was 4-6 flights leaving from Stockholm to Oslo that afternoon, but they hadn't fitted us un eithe rof them.

Although they market themselves as wanting to be THE best airline in Africa they are falling very short of this goal and don't seem to want to listen to customers to fix issues. I have had flights times moved forward without being notified, not had a special meal supplied even though I put it in the booking, not gotten the seats I pre-booked and got cheeky responses from customer service when I queried all these issues. Instead of just resolving the issue or apologising they become argumentative saying that their cabin crew did not report any issues. I am sure that the crew do not report every tiny little detail on the plane but the fact that I have taken the time to express my views should be enough for them to do something about it or at least deal with my complaint reasonably. Their definition of a special diet also leaves a lot to be desired. I request gluten free because I am allergic to gluten but my tray comes with pasta and bread and I get given the exact same meal for both meal services on the plane. I dont eat any processed foods and so when I ask for something to replace a rice cake, I get told to take it or leave it. I am loathe to book with them again, the customer just is not important to them and in my mind if they dont care what I want and need then how important is safety to them.",4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

So if you aren't Star Alliance, there are not other options. Additionally, many Ethiopian planes have not been updated so the seats are extremely close together and rarely have in-seat entertainment. Ethiopian flight attendants can be gruff or simply ignore your requests and the bathrooms on the flights do not include paper towels and are rarely checked.

Jul,2016.0,Dublin to LAX Trip From Hell,Dublin,Los Angeles International Economy,"Surprising but true that when we sought to return from Dublin the only airline flying nonstop from Dublin to LAX was Ethiopian Airlines. We bought our tickets and were amazed at the website offering 10-15 different meals in a drop-down menu. We made our selections and looked forward to our nonstop return on a newly purchased dreamliner. Any iota of excitement we had for the flight perished the day before the flight. We were unable to check in online and unable to reach customer service. They have a limited presence at Dublin Airport. Finally late in the day I reached someone who said we needed to get to the airport early with the credit card used to purchase the flight in order to check in. With a 5:55am flight this meant we were queued up at 3:30am. It took the agent an hour to process the credit card and get us checked in properly. We boarded and had a 2.5 hour delay getting off the ground. They didn't get keep us informed. There is no ice on the plane and the beverages are not refrigerated. I drank hot pineapple juice. The food was dreadful. They had no record of our vegetarian meal selection and eventually produced a bean dish with a side of beans. We got served this again before landing when they were serving breakfast. Everyone else was offered chicken or beef, or at breakfast, a simple egg and potato combo that surely is vegetarian. Worst of all, the flight was filled with adorable Ethiopian children that no one even attempted to subdue. They were overexcited about flying in an airplane, screaming and running all over. The flight attendants were wheeling them around on the beverage carts. It was impossible to sleep. It's also true that the seats are very narrow on the new Dreamliner. I have a few extra pounds but this has never been an issue before. Room for your hips and not much more. We had lots of legroom fortunately but were also near a restroom which had a lot of activity.

The started boarding one hour before scheduled time and everything was set for an early departure but the air traffic played spoil sport and we took off half an hour late.

It was atleast 50% bigger than that served on most other airlines like Turkish, Emirates etc.. Kudos to that. The flight attendants were very helpful and was very patient while responding to any requirements throughout the flight.

The inflight food tho, is among the worst I have ever had on a flight. Especially the breakfast, that in my opinion, is a joke! Another thing that I find very annoying is the fact that as a Star alliance member, they have two separate lounges for business/gold card passengers in Addis Abeba! They have one for the the members of their own ""Sheba"" lounge, and then they have a separate one for all the rest of Star Alliance members. This is something that no other airline have, or not what I have seen anyway! The quality of the Star alliance lounge are not up to standards in my opinion!

The management is trying to maximize the utilization of the aircraft. Connecting flights have little time between them. At Addis Ababa airport, many passengers are transferred directly from one aircraft to another. The computerized system is heavily relied upon in this. It is amazing to see their smooth operations. However, the operations were in chaos on 4 July 2016 due to a problem in their system. They dont seem to have an effective back-up system. My flight from Mumbai to Addis Ababa was late & the connecting flight to Abidjan was missed. I was directed to the inter-line counter. Processing was slow.

My family does not eat beef and the other option was chicken of fish, and there was never enough. My pre ordered vegetarian meal was poor tasting. The alcohol menu only has wine or beer. The staff are pleasant but are not very experienced and often seemed confused. The Addis Ababa airport is old and needs major upgrading so don't expect much. On my 4th connecting return flight, we were ushered on a bus directly to the connecting flight to Durban. When we got to the plane, our seats were occupied by other passengers. I preselected our seats and I was not happy. The inflight staff just told the passengers to sit anywhere. I insisted we change that and that got sorted. I was still standing with no seat while the plane was taxi to take off. The final straw was when we and the other passengers reached Durban, all our luggage was still in Addis Ababa. We are still waiting for our luggage and was told we might receive it on Friday 15 July 16. Fingers crossed cause in all my travelling this was my greatest fear.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Jul,2016.0,A very unrelaxing flight,Dublin,Los Angeles International Economy,"We picked this airline as it's the only one currently flying this route direct. We live in LA and we flew outbound on United with a stop in Newark using Airmiles. I should have probably figured it out but in fact Dublin to LAX is the 2nd half of a 2 part flight they fly from Addis Ababa to LAX. We boarded to find the flight 2/3 full of people (mostly Ethiopians) who'd flown the first leg. They had not been let off the plane at Dublin and so the plane had not been cleaned or freshened up in any way for our flight. We had a 2 1/2 hour delay due to a mechanical problem sitting on the tarmac which I do not hold against them as this can happen to any airline. Culturally there is a big difference between this airline and taking a US Airline: the food was very mediocre, they don't use ice at all in the drinks, it did take longer to pick up trash and I think a US flight would have passed out a few more drinks and snacks. We had requested the veggie option and got the exact same bean stew for both meals. But the biggest shock to me was that there were Ethiopian kids running up and down the aisles making a lot of noise and their parents just let them loose. The flight attendants were unfazed as if this was completely normal (we did see one give a kid a ride on her cart at one point). We sat in the exit row (row 28) and never had the usual exit row briefing. Another complication was that we were ticketed OK but then when we tried to check in online we were told there was a lingering problem with my credit card which seemed odd. It was sorted out at the airport OK. From what we could tell, checking in online in advance wouldn't have got us much as we still had to stand in line to check our bags. So with hindsight we would trade the value of this Ethiopian direct flight for two flights on a US airline.",3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Vast selection of inflight entertainment (games and movies) on 2 of the aircrafts (one aircraft lacked variety but was good enough). Food provided was really good - I, being also a frequent flyer, would rate it as 'much above average'. The Addis Ababa terminal is currently undergoing some refurbishment and therefore may tend to be a bit messy. Also some of the loungers at the terminal, though still comfortable, are not exactly new - wear and tear is quite visible on them.

Aug,2016.0,flight was delayed over four hours,Addis Ababa,Vienna,"In short, my flight was delayed over four hours due to mechanical problems, including with the plane's landing gear. The service from all members of staff we encountered was dismal. My flight was scheduled to depart Addis Ababa at 12.50am and arrive in Vienna at 5.50am. At Addis Ababa, we were directed to one entrance for security screening, whereupon staff closed the doors in our faces and directed us to a second entrance, the second entrance directed us back to the first entrance, we were then directed to a third entrance, where we waited a while, until being redirected to a fourth entrance. After boarding, we sat in the plane for forty five minutes before being told that the landing gear was broken. After another half an hour we were told that the air conditioning was also broken. The heat was sweltering. After a full hour and forty five minutes of this heat, the air stewardesses thought to bring us water. A stewardess handed the last cup to the passenger beside me, looked at me, then returned to the back of the plane. I pressed the call button three times over fifteen minutes. There were several other passengers also using their call buttons. Because I was sitting at the very back of the plane, I could hear the stewardesses chatting and laughing behind me. Finally I got out of my seat, walked past the stewardesses sitting around doing nothing, and poured myself a cup of water. In the end, the flight departed over four hours late, meaning that I missed connecting flights from Vienna to London and London to Montreal. In total I was in transit for 50 hours, rather than 38. I spoke to the airline's representative company, Celebi, in Vienna airport. Celebi provided me with accommodation and meals, but told me to call Ethiopian Airlines on the subject of further compensation. I called Ethiopian Airlines, and was told to talk to Austrian Airlines. I spoke to Austrian Airlines, who informed me that because the flight was operated by Ethiopian Airlines, I must speak to Ethiopian Airlines. I called Ethiopian Airlines again and it was confirmed to me that this was correct, but that I must contact Ethiopian Airlines via email.

Aug,2016.0,I didn't expect such poor service,Harare,London,"Harare to London Heathrow via Addis Ababa. Appalling to say the least. Ethiopian may have new aircraft but don't let this fool you. On the HRE-ADD sector I had to tell the cabin crew to issue an infant seat belt to someone travelling with an infant seated adjacent to me, this being after two cabin crew walked through to secure the cabin. The senior crew member left the trolley unattended in the middle of the cabin during the flight to help a colleague for a good 5 minutes. The crew had zero personality, and even asked 'what does she want' to a pax sat next to the pax the crew member was referring to. They did not offer a choice of meal and instead just said 'chicken' and dumped the tray on my table. I requested fish, she returned with a meal that had fish written on the lid but was actually vegetarian inside. There was no apology, just no personality with any of the crew on all four sectors. Credit where due, one meal was edible, the rest were cold and under cooked on all sectors. Out of all four sectors, I was only able to check in and choose my seat on one. Addis Ababa airport is dismal. They are seemingly meant to be upgrading the airport. I tried to buy a sandwich with my card but couldn't because the system was down. Security is horrendous. I am all for safe flying given the current times but you will need to allow at least an hour to pass through security as they then do a passport check - and don't take any duty free liquids as these are confiscated. I was reluctant to travel with Ethiopian Airlines more on a safety level but had minimal choice as Emirates was full. I didn't expect such poor service as well.",3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

The aircraft from Addis to Stockholm was a new Boeing 787, but the entertainment system was down during the entire flight. Our departure from Addis was delayed by one hour as the ground crew tried to fix the system, but without success. The cabin crew were arrogant and inattentive. They simply did not respond to calls. At one time I could see 18 unanswered calls in business class only. I had to physically stop the cabin attendants to get their attention. They apologized to me but left all the other calls unattended. The food was tasteless and boring. For breakfast we got a terrible lukewarm Pizza. We had ordered kids meals for our children, but the cabin attendants did not know this so we had to tell them to bring the right meals. Eventually we just found out that the kids meals hardly differ from the adult meals. A major drawback of Ethiopian is that many connections mean changing flights in Addis Ababa. The airport is dirty (especially the toilets) and totally overcrowded. Passengers are only allowed to enter the waiting areas 90 minutes prior to the flights. Until then they have to wait in the general terminal and sit on the floor just to see all the empty chairs in the closed waiting area.

Watching what unfolded in the cabin it quickly became clear that only white people were subject to their ideas of switching places, taking all their stuff with them every time. That was especially bad.

Aug,2016.0,Never again!,Washington DC,Harare International Economy,"If you can, please avoid this airline. There was nothing positive about our travel experience. These are a few problems that we had with our flights, listed in no particular order. 1. The airline ran out of food with the second meal served. We sat on the runway in Washington for more than an hour (delayed). I'm not sure what was being loaded on the plane at that time but food apparently wasn't an option. At least 30 people were told that all of the food was gone, several of whom were children. 2. Beware, if you have a special food request. I placed my food request at the time of booking the flight, several months in advance. We even called the day before our flight to ensure that the accommodation was made. To my horror, one meal was prepared on one flight, the snacks and remaining meals were unaccounted for. To make matters worse, I was given what was supposed to be gluten free items but they were not gluten free. I took a couple of bites before I realized that the items were not what they were supposed to be. The food in general is just poor. The meal that my daughter was given made her break out into a rash a couple hours later. The rash (very itchy ring) remained around her mouth for almost a week. 3. Rundown equipment. Many of the seats are broken (will not recline) and/or the television units do not work. This also was the case on the dreamliner and it is only a couple of years old. 4. Filth/Nothing is clean. This includes the cups that you are given during meals for coffee and/or tea. The ones that we were given had been clearly used and not cleaned. Some even had lipstick on them and they were served to us. The bathroom from Addis Abbaba to IAD with a stop in Dublin is worse than an out house toilet. I have never seen diapers, toilet paper, tooth brushes, and other items covering the floor. The bathroom nearest my seat was so overloaded with trash that the door would not fully open. 5. The airport in Ethiopia is not people friendly. The bathrooms are not clean, the airport in general lacks adequate seating, if you have small children I would avoid it entirely. People are stockpiled on top of one another, limited dining options if you are hungry, no places to sit except the floor. 6. Unfriendly flight staff. I have traveled the world on different airlines. I have never experienced a trip where none of the flight staff smile or are welcoming. If you ask a question, they appear to be bothered. In many cases, rushing off to never return with an answer to your question. In addition, they are totally careless with airline protocol. During take-off and landing children were running down the aisles, hopping the aisles (some adults were even walking around).",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

So the windows dim electronically, and the business class seats lay flat. The food is rather standard, but the Ethiopian snacks were African and exotic. My daughter and I really enjoyed our first sampling of kolo. Service met expectations for business class. The announcements were in English and Ethiopian. Again, we had a great time trying to absorb our first sampling of the spoken Ethiopian language. The airline is a Star Alliance carrier and shares a flight code with ANA. We were invited to the ANA lounges which were flagship quality in Narita. If you're in a rush, skip dinner at the airport and just eat free at the lounge. We had the usual small delays, arriving early in Tokyo and late back in Hong Kong. But this is not unusual for frequent flyers and within tolerable parameters.

Our outbound flight was during the week, so economy was less than half full and we were able to stretch out in an entire row and sleep. Our return flight was on a weekend and very full, so we didn't have the luxury of sleeping. The flight attendants are not as strict with cabin protocol and safety requirements as we experience with the major US carriers, especially when it came to keeping children from running in the aisles, often without parental supervision.

My flight was scheduled to depart Addis Ababa at 12:50am and arrive in Vienna at 5:50am. At Addis Ababa, we were directed to one entrance for security screening, whereupon staff closed the doors in our faces and directed us to a second entrance; the second entrance directed us back to the first entrance; we were then directed to a third entrance, where we waited a while, until being redirected to a fourth entrance. After boarding, we sat in the plane for forty five minutes before being told that the landing gear was broken. After another half an hour we were told that the air conditioning was also broken. The heat was sweltering. After a full hour and forty five minutes of this heat, the air stewardesses thought to bring us water. A stewardess handed the last cup to the passenger beside me, looked at me, then returned to the back of the plane. I pressed the call button three times over fifteen minutes. There were several other passengers also using their call buttons. Because I was sitting at the very back of the plane, I could hear the stewardesses chatting and laughing behind me. Finally I got out of my seat, walked past the stewardesses sitting around doing nothing, and poured myself a cup of water. In the end, the flight departed over four hours late, meaning that I missed connecting flights from Vienna to London and London to Montreal. Because of this, I missed work that evening and lost a substantial amount of income. In total I was in transit for 50 hours, rather than 38. I spoke to the airline's representative company, Celebi, in Vienna airport. Celebi provided me with accommodation and meals, but told me to call Ethiopian Airlines on the subject of further compensation. I called Ethiopian Airlines, and was told to talk to Austrian Airlines. I spoke to Austrian Airlines, who informed me that because the flight was operated by Ethiopian Airlines, I must speak to Ethiopian Airlines. I called Ethiopian Airlines again and it was confirmed to me that this was correct, but that I must contact Ethiopian Airlines via email. I did so and have been waiting almost a month for a reply.",3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Upon the first part of the flight, I was served a bread that looked like it has started to grow fungus or molds. So I asked for another bread without stating about the first one. Then the second one turned to be even more worse. The cabin crew gave me false excuses saying first that it was garlic and then another one said it was sesame seeds.

The leg room was better than all the other carriers I have flown with and I would fly with them again. I would rate them better than American and on par with Virgin (although the food and entertainment on Virgin was probably better).

Aug,2016.0,Best Airline Direct to Africa From the United States,Washington DC,Nairobi International Economy,"From Dulles Airport (IAD), Ethiopian Airlines fly non-stop to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (ADD). After a quick 40 minute layover, you board your next flight on to Nairobi (NBO). This route is by far the shortest to Kenya from Washington. The plane from IAD to ADD (and return) is a B777-300. Seating is a 3-4-3 configuration. In economy, each seat has a TV with a fairly large variety of movies, television shows, audio, and a GPS flight system. Each seat also has a USB port to charge your phone. There are no AC outlets in economy. They keep you well fed, and offer cola, juice, water, beer and wine. Seats are standard width and pitch, but there are foot rests. Pillows, blankets, and an amenity kit featuring socks, toothbrush and toothpaste, and an eye mask is provided. The plane from ADD to NBO was a 737 and on the return flight was a 767. The 737 only had overhead screens, but the 767 had seat-back TVs. The short, 1.5 hour flight to Nairobi featured a meal and drinks. One of the reasons I always choose Ethiopian when flying to Kenya is because unlike all other flights, Ethiopian gets you to Nairobi at 10:30 a.m. instead of late in the afternoon. This makes for a much quicker trip from the airport to downtown by avoiding the horrible, horrible afternoon traffic. This schedule also allows you to avoid spending the night in Nairobi if your final destination is elsewhere in Kenya. A word about the ADD airport: The airport is undergoing a major, well-deserved renovation. Keep your layover short. There is little there currently to occupy your time.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Aug,2016.0,Different experience,London,Mombasa International Economy,"We (family of 2 adults and 3 children aged 17,14 and 11) recently flew from Heathrow to Mombassa via Addis Ababa. This included a long flight lasting 6 hours and a shorter one of 2 hours with a stop over of a few hours. Check in at Heathrow was a little chaotic as having never flown from there before we first of all had to do a self service check in before we handed our luggage over. Overall we found the aeroplane environment spacious, modern and comfortable, with blankets and pillows for our night flights; and entertainment on each leg of our journey (individual on the long haul, and tv from the ceiling on the shorter flight) included current and good choice of movies. We found the staff very pleasant and helpful. Food service was average and a little more spicy than usual; while the drinks service was inadequate with room temperature drinks being poured into plastic cups from large bottles. As we had purchased several drinks from Heathrow before our outward journey we were sufficiently hydrated, however on our homeward journey drinks were confiscated at the final security check at Addis Ababa (even though we'd purchased them at the airport), therefore we all only had 2 small cups of water/ pop/ juice for a full 6 hour flight which is ridiculous! Addis Ababa is a very chaotic, busy airport, dirty in parts ( so be prepared and take tissues and wipes!) which seems to act as a gateway between Europe and the rest of the world! As such it has many people waiting for connecting flights but fails to provide adequate seating. We had a 7 hour stop over and 4 of those hours were spent sitting on the floor. It does have several recliner chairs which are fought over but still not enough. It has plenty of toilets which the cleaners do their best to maintain, it also has prayer rooms and smoking rooms. It does not have enough public places to eat, we only saw one bar which was heaving. It does however seem to have several lounges which obviously come at a cost, if we travelled this route again we would definitely book into. The overall experience added to our Kenyan adventure, however had my children been younger I would not have put them through it. If we undertook this type of journey again I would be put off by a stop over at Addis Ababa.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Aug,2016.0,Terrible experience at the Delhi airport,New Delhi,Newark International Economy,"I was flying from Delhi to New York (Newark) with a layover in Addis Ababa. While waiting to check-in, an Ethiopian Airlines manager was checking over everyone's passport for visa. I am Canadian, so I do not need a visa when visiting the US. This manager did not know this (and did not believe me), and said he wanted to check over records and asked me to wait. This ""checking over records"" took almost an hour. In fact, he did not check records at all, and the whole process was so unprofessional. He sent someone to ask the staff at other airlines because none of the Ethiopian Air staff had any idea. Then he was still not convinced so they tried to call people at the US consulate in India (which is ridiculous because it was like 11pm and such information is readily available online). If Ethiopian Airlines is operating a flight to New York, the manager who checks passports should first know the information regarding who requires a visa. If not, he should at least have access to documents that he can easily check for such information (which again, is also available online on official websites). When I complained about the delay, the manager said ""You are going to the USA, so I have to be satisfied"" and was not even apologetic for not knowing things which is part of his job. I understand the importance of security control at airports, but this should not allow Ethiopian Air staff to assume an authoritative role and boss around travelers with valid documents. This made the whole flight experience really terrible, and I would not recommend flying with Ethiopian Airlines to anyone.",3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Food, drinks, duty free were all average. As a passenger, it's all about seats and service when I am on board. Both worked well. Comfortable seats with decent legroom and a power point together with an above average service from a competent, friendly and well presented crew made for a positive travel experience. The not-so-positive part of the experience is Addis Abbaba airport. Small terminal, crowded and disorganised. Felt like ""organised chaos"". Especially unpleasant is the boarding queueing.

Sep,2016.0,no apologies onboard from anyone re the delay,Tel Aviv,Kinshasa,"Just returned from a short trip Tel Aviv - Addis Ababa - Kinshasa - Addis Ababa - Tel Aviv. Unfortunately Ethiopian Airlines is always a let down in one way or another. I believe this will be my last trip with them. Its back to AF/KL/BA/LH. The way over was great, B738 TLV to ADD, friendly crew, good food, comfortable bulkhead seat and nice music channels. Addis Bole airport is an insult to ET and Star Alliance. Crowded, dirty, disgusting bathrooms, chaotic boarding procedures. The B772 to FIH was empty, so I had 3 seats for myself and the crew were friendly (all females). The return trip was a very different story, it's where ET fails in every aspect of service. I had a reserved seat FIH-ADD, emergency exit, as I need leg room to avoid back pain and free access to the bathroom. Of course ET changed equipment at the last minute to B738, I lost my good seat and on top of it a two hour delay in Kinshasa due to the Aircraft change. No word from the local staff re the delay, no word about AC change, I had to struggle with a most unfriendly agent to get an aisle seat. No apologies onboard from anyone re the delay, not the Captain nor the Inflight manager. I guess passengers should expect to lose their long time assigned seats, spend hours waiting and get zero 'sorry'. One Cabin crew member was great when I told her my story, she was apologetic, sincere and warm. When landing in ADD, passengers started opening overheads while in taxi, left them open so items could fall and injure passengers. The crew did nothing to stop this. Again Bole airport a crowded dirty mess, the flight to TLV was late one hour without any explanation, I guess it's the norm at ET. The only shining Star at ET is their cabin crew. I made it home safely and that's all that counts.",2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,AirlineQuality
Sep,2016.0,experience is horrible,Cotonou,Nairobi,"Chaotic boarding in Cotonou, plane 45 minutes late with no apologies from the crew. No earphones distributed at any point for the entertainment system and not even an inflight magazine. Do not let Ethiopian’s ads on their new fleet fool you - planes (737s with Sky Interior in this case) are not properly looked after. On the Cotonou-Addis flight, there was fruit jam on the tablet and chewing-gum in the seat pocket. The seat covers were worn and falling apart. The overhead screens were not working and kept coming up and down. Very slow service with disgusting food and it took the crew about an hour and a half to clear the trays. Addis Ababa airport is a horrific place. Overcrowded, dirty, smelly (especially since the smoking areas do not close hence people smoke outside). The shops are a disgrace, with no fixed prices and people haggling over the price of items. Most items are just lying on the floor or on broken shelves, still in their delivery packages. Credit card payments did not work in two duty free shops out of three. The Ethiopian/Star Alliance Gold lounge is dark, dirty and has a very limited food choice. When I entered nobody was at the reception to scan my boarding pass. It is usually impossible to find a seat available in the evening. Better to stay outside and sit on the floor. The toilets, both in the lounge and outside, are dirty and smelly. Ethiopian Airlines ground staff are impolite, permanently yells at passengers to rush them to the gates and does not answer questions when asked something. Be careful as flights are not announced or the general chaos can lead one to miss the boarding announcements and therefore, the flight. Addis-Nairobi was similarly terrible, with tired seats (despite the young age of the aircraft, another 737 with Sky Interior). It was once again 45 minutes late with no apologies whatsoever. No earphones or inflight magazine, once again. No pre-take off checks, most people had their seatback down and/or were using laptops and electronic devices. Food very bad, with crew throwing the tray on the tablets saying “chicken” and again, the overhead screens were dysfunctional. I should also mention that at no point in Cotonou or Addis were there separate queues for Business/Gold members and Economy passengers during boarding, with disorganised queues, staff yelling in every direction and in general, a sense of squalor. It is a real pity to be sometimes forced to use Ethiopian Airlines because of the lack of competition in African skies. Avoid at all costs and prefer Kenya Airways whenever possible.",1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

I mean, they were being so loud that they were waking all of us up during the WHOLE 10+ hours in the air. 2) I am sorry to say this but the people smelled bad and it stunk the whole airplane. I wanted to throw up the moment I step inside the aircraft. I understand some cultural differences and this may not be the airlines' fault but it smelled so bad I rather pay 5 K not to ever do this again.

The food was a disaster of course but what was really irritating was the service, the crew was more eager to catch up on gossip amongst themselves than attend to passengers. One girl missed whole sections of her work area when serving food and we had to almost fight to get her back. Ask for water and pray it will come. My Neighbour asked three times and had to walk to the kitchen to get his water in the end. Got there asked for water, the girls pointed him in the direction of the shelf because, u guessed it they were chatting. I was in a party of 5 and the other members begged me to change airlines on our way back. Before we even landed. Well we never actually landed in a sense. I don't think hitting the tarmac as hard as a plane can actually hit the tarmac one level short of a crash qualifies as landing. Both in Addis Ababa and Frankfurt.

In flight entertainment-both music and movies- were dated, but we found somethings to watch. The food was not appetizing. Here is something I've never seen happen-the flight attendants did not make any real effort to come by and pick up the trays after people finished eating.

Sep,2016.0,It should be called Cheat-iopian Airlines,Johannesburg,Mumbai International Economy,"Booked a multi-city flight from BOM-CPT and then return from JNB-BOM... For onward journey, selected seat on 39th row window and aisle.. Got web-checked in and printed the boarding pass which showed exactly the same seats I booked... To our surprise when we went to BOM airport, we were given some other boarding pass.. when we refused to accept and showed our printed passes, they said the aircraft might have changed and the new one do not have any 39th row window seat. that is the last row!!! the aircraft from Addis to CPT was terrible, no screen behind the seats.. foams coming out.. While returning it was even more scary.. we booked flight ET640 from Addis to BOM which was in a gap of 3 hours connecting to JNB to Addis.. We intentionally choose this flight to have a safe time gap between two flights and paid 4000 INR extra per person (there were total 4 of us) as compared to flight ET 610 which is at one hour gap.. when we got the boarding pass from JNB, it was for ET 640 itself, but when we landed in Addis, we were directly taken to aircraft 610 which was about to take off. we told the ground staff that our ticket is for the next flight, but they said next flight is cancelled and we have already transferred your luggage to this aircraft, you have to take this flight only, there was no other option. We were harassed like anything.. after landing in Mumbai we inquired and found that flight ET 640 was also flying behind and expected to reach at scheduled time!!

Sep,2016.0,Have miles to go,Mumbai,Mombasa International Economy,"Have used the airline service a few years back and the memories and service made me choose the flight again this time, when i wanted to travel with them five years later. As time pass by we all move to greater heights and for my surprise in this case it was the opposite. It could be an odd incident as i said i have never experienced this before with Ethiopian Airlines. I was travelling with lots of expectation and hope to see changes but to my surprise i had a terrible time. It was indeed a long journey for me as i was travelling from india to Kenya where i had to change three flights in between to reach here. A comfort seating and a decent service is something which we all need in such time. Out of my three flights the first one was a domestic flight and my experience with Ethiopian Airline stared from my second flight. My first flight was ET611 which didn’t had any issues at all and was comfortable. Things changed when i took the second flight which was ET 322. My arm rest had some sort of Glue on top, either it could be from a sticker which was used earlier or could be from a Chewing gum (Which i don’t think it is as no one would normally do that in a flight apart from kids) . Since i had a wet tissue with me it was wiped and didn’t bothered to inform the same to the flight attendant as they were also getting ready for the checks before take off. After take off i thought of checking the onboard entertainment and to my surprise it was a total disaster as the control buttons on the arm rest never responded apart from the light switch and the switch for Cabin assistance, but some how i managed to select what i wanted as it was a touch screen display, to listen i looked for the earphones for which i found 4 sets in the seat pocket which almost convinced me why there was glue on the arm rest, as i thought the preflight check was not done properly. I tried to believe that it could be an odd incident as mistakes happens and for some unfortunate reason i ended up in that seat. But things never stopped there. As we reached the cruising altitude the attendants started serving onboard meals, to my surprise the stewardess just waved her hand and gave me a tray to which she didn’t bothered to ask whether do i need a meal or not and if so if i do have any choice as this is done in all flights. At the same time she never asked if i need any beverage along with my meal, not even a glass of water. once when i assumed either she had a tough day or something went wrong i decided to call her for which she again didn’t responded. Meanwhile i had the meal what was given, as i had no choice but to eat like a prisoner. Decided to wait again till they come back after the meals were distributed. This time i had to raise my arms and wave as the way she did. Got luck this time as she stopped and asked how could she assist to which i requested for a glass of water. To my surprise she again got disappeared for a while then came back for the clearance where i reminded her about the water. she apologised and said will bring it and again disappeared. I looked around and found all the other travellers were having their meals where i also noticed that i was the only one with a different ethnicity or some one who looked different. Odd thoughts went through my mind but still tried to believe it was my wrong way of thinking. To my surprise again, i saw the same stewardess who was doing the clearance while they were passing by i again reminded her the same this time i was lucky as she was accompanied with an another flight stewardess who over heard and came with a glass of water. All this time i made sure the switch for the flight assistance was on but still decided to call them personally as i could see there were few other travellers did the same and none was attended assuming that the flight attendants were pretty busy with their schedule. overall it was a horrible experience on my second flight and the concern is i did booked by return with the same flight on November. As i mentioned things could go wrong once in a while in this case i was the unlucky person. Electronics and other accessories might have problems and will have, which can only be rectified later and cannot be repaired during a flight which we all agree. But a personal service can be checked and rectified then and there. Hope Ethiopian Airlines will look in to this issues and will make the service better as we all learn from our small mistakes. Apart from my personal experience which went wrong due to some odd circumstances i think the Airline service is ok and value for what you pay for. Its a suggestion and experience shared to the Airlines not a warning for travellers.",3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Surprise surprise the plane left with a number of empty seats. The food on the plane be it meals or snacks need a complete change. I have never been on an Ethiopian flight from Addis that left on time to any destination be it domestic or international.

Oct,2016.0,no recourse from airline,Washington DC,Belize City,"Washington to Blantyre via Addis Ababa. Stranded with no recourse from airline. Booked tickets in May for travel in December. Tickets paid for and confirmed, yet prior to travelling they cancelled reservation for one leg of the journey. Called agents and they informed me that they cancelled reservation but unable to give answer as to why they cancelled reservation. Finally got rebooked after four phone calls but still on waiting list for last leg of journey. Called again and they say no seats available. Went online and I can clearly see seats available and am able to book on the final leg myself. Informed Ethiopian Airlines of the seat availability and they said they will see what they can do. Nothing done to resolve problem. Encountered many lies from agents, they will inform that they will call you back but dont have your hopes up for this, they will never call you. If you call to follow up be prepared to be disconnected for no reason. Also remember according to them, it's never their fault. If anything goes wrong with booking you will suffer because the reservations agents are incompetent and unwilling to resolve problem. No one can explain how a confirmed booking can be cancelled yet the same journey can be repurchased online again, so flights were not cancelled but reservation cancelled for a phantom reason. After desperation, I ended up paying for another ticket, which is much easier to do than to deal with the airlines agents. Pay a little more and travel another airline, its not worth being stranded in another country and the airline will not do anything about it. I would understand if flights get cancelled but clearly not the case in this situation.",1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

The airline promised to deliver the in flight meals to the hotel rooms, they did not. At 8:20am guests were called to return to the airport for a rescheduled 10:50am flight. On arrival at the departure gate, the screen announced that this flight was also now delayed until 12:00pm. No airline staff were around for information or reassurance. Flight finally departed and arrived at the scheduled destination >24 hours later. This resulted in the loss of an entire day, loss of a nights paid accommodation and loss of tour bookings.

Oct,2016.0,Most importantly safe! Dont ask for anything else.,Addis Ababa,Rome International Economy,"I fly Ethiopian all the time and my reasons for this are as follows: 1. Ethiopian has a lot to be proud of and this pride enables them to take their safety check and regular maintenance rather seriously - specifics to the outside and engine maintenance. I had experiences of where doubts in technicalities impediments were dealt with utmost seriousness. Also mid air eventualities are handled rather well and their pilots are reasonably well trained to deal with unforeseen circumstances. Hence, I do consider this airline safe on many counts. How often have you heard of Ethiopian having to make an emergency landing or crash (well historically one was due to terrorism and the other no one knows, as far as I can remember). 2. Network: The connectivity network of Ethiopian is far more extensive than many African airlines; hence my reach to African and European destinations are far more accessible using Ethiopian. 3. Cost and price: Reasonable to an extent, especially within Africa and to Europe, but to America's and Asia - nothing beats the likes of Qatar and Emirates both in terms of cost and comfort. What I don't like about Ethiopian: 1. Business hospitality: This is one industry that Ethiopian will probably never get themselves right despite being in business for 78 years. I wish they could be as hospitable as they traditionally are, but lets not confuse business hospitality with traditions here. What I mean to imply is that; information is not accurately shared - especially when flights are delayed and the support you provide to passengers when flights are delayed is almost non existent. The one's who fight and argue with the ground crew are the one's who benefit. What I mean is that this company does not given passenger comfort and attention, I don't think its their priority. 2. Inflight service: Most cabin crew are courteous, while some seem lost. However, the worst part of Ethiopian is that, they do not maintain their aircrafts on the inside for passenger comfort (I was on a Dreamliner). For eg: I had to change my seat three times on this leg of journey because my seat was either broken or the cushion kept sliding as it was not fixed or the back rest doesn't hold still. The inflight crew were like; 'you've got to manage Sir as we are a full flight. I just asked them if it was ok for me to stand for the rest of my journey - which ofcourse they objected'. The inflight entertainment system although old was very much inaccessible as the touch screens weren't working and pretty difficult to control. 3. Cleanliness: Another massive flaw in this airline which reflects on passenger comfort yet again; they do not clean their seats - which have stains and neither do they clean the area around the seats as often I find left over scraps of food or scraps of paper or plastic. Anyways, I have learnt to deal with the situation. I tend to avoid Ethiopian if its a long haul flight, cause to me passenger comfort in this case is just as important as flight safety. However, on short haul flights I stick to Ethiopian. Hope this helps. Cheers!",1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

The on board entertainment is fairly good too. The aircraft offers ample legroom and comfortable, clean seats. The service can be a little curt, however our interaction was limited so it didn't bother us. The halt at Addis Ababa was a little inconvenient while on our way to SA, as the terminal was dated with make-shift bathrooms and no food stores. Also finding our gate for the connecting flight was confusing. However, while on our return the Terminal was way better and no problem. Make sure to book your meal in advance if you don't eat beef or are vegetarian as there are no alternate options. Food in general is not great, it is better to carry some snacks of your own.

Oct,2016.0,Issues in Addis Ababa,Dar es Salaam,Goma Africa Economy,"On the 22nd of October my wife and I departed Dar es Salam (Tanzania) to Goma (DRC) for a holiday to Virunga National Park. The flight was through Ethiopian Airlines and would need us to transit in Addis Ababa for a few hours. At Addis, when re-boarding for Goma, we were not allowed to board because our documentation for Congo was apparently not correct (even though this was checked in Dar before boarding initially) After missing the flight, the good crew rechecked our documentation, (which was already checked in Dar es Salam) and verified that all was indeed correct and that we were 'wrongly offloaded' The ground crew did not apologize, did not empathize or even offer any assistance and refused to offer us accommodation or assistance ""because his supervisor was not there and could not authorize anything"" After a heated discussion with the customer care official at another office (who assisted immediately) we were given vouchers for a hotel in Addis and a temporary visa for two days because the next available flight was only in two days time (Monday the 24th October) The ground crew also promised to call the hotel to discuss flight options with me over the weekend which did not happen and again, only after I called the airport myself on Sunday did I manage to push my return flights over by two days From the time of the Saturday the 22nd, no one from Ethiopian Airlines offered explanation, assistance, kept promises, returned calls or answered emails (I wrote to the online listed customer care, reservations, public relations and internal airport departments) On Monday the 24th when we again returned to the airport, our return flights were still not booked on the system and again the very helpful airport customer care officials assisted us further. The airline did change our flight tickets as requested at the last minute (thanks to the airport customer care) but we still have had no other correspondence, explanation or apology - and NO discussion whatsoever of the lost revenue on booked accommodation because of the admitted Ethiopian Airlines mistake I will only ever book or recommend Ethiopian airlines if no other airline flies to the desired location in the future Warren Baty",3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Oct,2016.0,What a surprisingly great experience,Nairobi,Addis Ababa Africa Business Class,"I was making the relatively short hop from Nairobi to Addis Ababa one early evening recently. Check in was highly efficient as was the passage through immigration and security. Boarding took place at least 30 minutes before takeoff. On ascending the steps I realised that the plane was a Boeing 787 - a Dreamliner! My seat in the second row in Business class was large, comfortable with all the latest mod cons. Flat bed functionality was a big, positive surprise given the 90 minute flight time. The entertainment system was also modern with loads of choice. As I settled down to watch a movie I was offered a glass of champagne and a soothing refreshing towel. I had a slight initial concern as I could not get any reasonable sound out of my headphones but the busy stewardess brought me one set after another until we found one that worked. As soon as the seat belt sign was switched off after take off my order of a Bloody Mary arrived followed shortly afterwards by meal. This comprised something they called a Greek salad, main course of an Arabic style lamb stew and a piece of carrot cake. I washed this all down with a few glasses of red South African wine. I had selected a 90 minute film to watch. We touched down exactly as the final credits were rolling. Perfect timing. On deplaning we were directed to a waiting bus reserved for the business class passengers. For once I enjoyed the bus journey to the terminal in a non crushing non dehumanising environment. On passing swiftly through immigration my luggage was already emerging on the belt in the arrivals hall. This was an absolutely super experience from start to finish.",5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,TripAdvisor

Oct,2016.0,Surprisingly good airline,Toronto,Johannesburg International Economy,"I was very skeptical about using this airline to travel over such a long distance. Prior to booking my tickets, I had read very mixed reviews from ""extremely poor"" to ""very good"". After much hesitation I decided to try it out. I was really pleasantly surprised. I have travelled many times between Canada and South Africa over the past 30 years and have tried most of the available routes, even ones that have since been discontinued. Ethiopian Airlines is as good as most, and is certainly far better than Air Canada which I have no idea how it manages to pass as a ""first world"" airline. The food on Ethiopian Airlines is decent - nothing to rave about, but also nothing to complain about. You get the standard choice of ""beef"" or ""chicken"" and you get vegetables and rice. They also make drinks available quite often. The flights attendants are very warm and friendly and they have a very humane side to them. They don't mind carrying infants whilst their parents are trying to sort out their onboard luggage, etc. I found them to be very accommodating and nothing was an issue. I certainly did not sense a bad attitude on any of them. Quite the opposite actually. The flights are only slightly delayed. I was worried about connecting in Addis Ababa as I only had 90 minutes and the flight out of Toronto was delayed by 30 minutes. But I got directed straight to the gate which was a few minutes walk and there was more than enough time. The airport in Addis Ababa is just okay, not great. I made the mistake of not taking USD cash with me when returning from Johannesburg. The Visa machines were out and I couldn't even buy a bottle of water. I had also purchased duty free wine in Johannesburg and when exiting the flight from Johannesburg to Addis Ababa, I somehow got directed (as others were) into the duty free, restaurant, toilet areas and then had to go back through security when going to my gate. I could not proceed with the wine and it had to eventually be checked into regular luggage (my laptop was sacrificed as cargo luggage and I had to transfer clothes to my laptop bag to give the wine bottles some padding to prevent breakage). On other flights the luggage checked in at the gate is available for collection on exiting the aircraft, but not in this case. The wine in my small laptop bag came out on the conveyor belt with regular luggage - let's just say I was pleasantly surprised that my wine bottles were intact, but there should be some sort of warning on this, like ""when exiting the aircraft, go straight into the next boarding gate to avoid going through security again"". I met others who had the same issue so this didn't seem to be an obvious mistake. Other than that, my luggage was intact (I can't say the same for South African airways which I had flown the prior time and where my luggage, which was locked, was tampered with). The next time I fly to South Africa I will definitely consider Ethiopian Airlines first before any other airline. The flights are a nice duration and there aren't long stopovers in Addis Ababa. Especially from Toronto to Johannesburg, the total journey was just over 19 hours. That's not very common. On the way back, it was longer as we stopped to refuel in Dublin, but it was still shorter than the routes offered by the other airlines. The cost of the return journey was cheaper than any other airline as well.",2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Oct,2016.0,Much better than expected,Cape Town Central,Rome International Business Class,"Staff attitudes throughout on our Ethopian flights were five-star. The flight CT-AA on the Boeing 767-300 was typical business-class: very good (typical business-class) food, excellent service, comfortable seats that folded just about flat, plenty of space, attractive and helpful air hostesses, but the cabin was showing its age (TV etc entertainment and equipment is “old” and limited). On the way back, AA-CT, the same experience, except the food was typically Ethiopian, tasty and most interesting - yebeg alicha (mild spicy lamb stew) with gomen (Ethiopian kale) and injira, a traditional bread made from teff - really tasty. One comment: a Western-style, lighter meal was not on offer - only stews and ragouts, which need changing (people want to eat light on long flights) . This added a different “dimension” to the experience. Let’s say four–star for both flights, but an extra half star for the Ethiopian food. Wines were typical, nothing to get excited about (compared with the excellent wines on Turkish Airlines) and I tried the Ethiopian wines, but wont bother next time! Their climate cannot be conducive to growing good wines. One criticism would be that you board the AA–CT flight at around 09h00 but no breakfast is served (though you may ask for a snack). I guess they expect you to have breakfast in the lounge before take off. The flights AA-Rome and Rome-AA were both on the new Boeing Dreamliner, but sadly both took off around mid-night so we went straight to sleep, in each case waking up just in time to touch down – cannot remember if they offered breakfast before Rome arrival. However, the cabin is very slick and modern. As to the business-class lounge in Addis Ababa, the stop over on the way north was about five hours, which is quite tedious after a long day. Coming south is not as long – and of course, going north to a different destination could result in a shorter stop over. My recommendation would be to try to reduce the stop-over time. On the other hand, the lounge is big and spacious, again with attentive staff – even with a lot of passengers, one did not get the feeling of being cramped as in most business class lounges nowadays. Looking at the lounge through a woman’s eyes, it was not properly clean - and the ablution facilities are definitely not up to standard and need modernising. The food is typically Ethiopian, but nevertheless interesting and fulfilling, if not sophisticated. Lots of shops, “African” rather than “Western” in style but interesting enough to keep you busy browsing. Let’s say a three-and-a-half-star experience: some aspects three-star, but spaciousness was five–star. To sum up: the standards of business class travel are much the same for all airlines and maybe some are a bit slicker than others. But, if you are sleeping, the seats are all the same! Ethiopian has a nice “African” style in what it offers – and, at the price, it is a “no brainer”! So in terms of value for money, definitely five-star!",2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,TripAdvisor

Oct,2016.0,Horrendous Experience,London,Cape Town Central International Economy,"Horrendous experience. I was working in Cape Town and upon complete my partner was flying out from the UK to join me for a holiday. His 21:00 flight was cancelled due to a technical fault, the plane was missing a wheel part that had to be sourced from Hungary that apparently they only realised when about to board?! Guests were taken at 22:00 to a holiday inn an overnight delay. At the holiday inn, the airline attempted to book guests into shared rooms, which of course they objected too. Guests were finally booked into hotel rooms at 2:00am. The airline promised to bring the in flight meals to the hotel rooms, the meal was never received. Guests were awoken at 08:20 to be taken to the airport for a rescheduled 10:50am flight. Upon arrival at the department gate, the screen stated the flight had been delayed again until 12:00pm. No airline staff were available for information or reassurance, a separate agency company were dealing with the rescheduled flight and could not provide any information regarding the connecting flight to the final destination. The guests were told to board the rescheduled flight from London to Ethiopia, connecting flights would be resolved by Ethiopian Airlines at Addas Ababa - essentially flying to one destination without knowing how you were going to get to the intended destination. Utterly outrageous. During this time I was in Cape Town by myself trying to reorganise our planned accommodation and tours, the lack of information from the airline was extremely unhelpful and made the entire situation very stressful. The rescheduled flight took him from London to Ethiopia, where he had to wait another night before he could fly to Cape Town. He therefore arrived >26 hours later than planned. I appreciate these situations can happen, but the handling of the situation was completely ridiculous. The standard of the plane and services were also below expectation; none of the in flight entertainment screens were working. I am so appalled with the service received.

Nov,2016.0,new A350 plane impressive,Cape Town,London,"A round trip from Cape Town to London via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. On the link between Addis and London was on their new A350 plane. V impressive, quiet spacious, with good space and excellent entertainment system. The other leg Cape Town to and from Addis was on the B767. Less impressive, more cramped, noiser with limited entertainment - still seat back but tiny. Service on all legs was excellent. Friendly and helpful staff with good information and announcements. Food ok - I asked for a special meal and was provided. Transit at Addis is straightforward. You can be directed right into the waiting area. If you are remember no facilities here apart from toilets and seats. It does get very crowded especially if you are in the area for gates 1-7 in the International terminal which uses buses to and from the gates. But organised in that announcements are made and there are good screens showing the information. If you are a premium customer or Star Alliance Gold but travelling economy you can use a separate area in that section - comfortable chairs, water and separate buses. Ethiopian do look after regular travellers and their premium customers. Their prices are often the cheapest between southern africa and Europe. Give them a go if on a budget but be prepared for a transit in Addis that doesn't have all the creature comforts you might want so try and keep transit times to a minimum.

Nov,2016.0,problems started on the way back,Tel Aviv,São Paulo,"Round trip from Tel Aviv to Sao Paulo via Addis Ababa. The quality of the journey was way different between the flight forth and the flight back. The first, was a very nice experience highlighting a very kind onboard service and amazing aircraft (Addis Abeba - Sao Paulo by a Boeing 787). But problems started on the way back. First, the aircraft was changed without any previous notification. The original flight was supposed to be flown also by a Boeing 787 but instead aircraft was changed to an old and dirty Boeing 777-2. I received an aisle seat which was pretty broken: the control panel on the handrail was destroyed and the touch-screen did not react to tact, but it had to be controlled by the broken panel on the handrail. Besides I stand up to the bathroom in 3 occasions during the flight while in all of them the lavatories were stinky and disgusting. Unfortunately, problems did not finish there since my bag was mistreated during the journey resulting in a broken wheel and the handle which was very hard to lift. On my arrival to the Airport in Tel Aviv I approached Aerohandling counters (the company handling Ethiopian Airlines in-land services at TLV), I was attended by a very rude man, and I was denied service while I was given a letter saying that the company will not be responsible for the damage caused to my luggage. I sent several e-mails to the company complaining about this situation until they finally answered. They promised they will respond for the damage caused to my belongings also promising that I will be contacted by the company.

Nov,2016.0,the worst customer service,Addis Ababa,Windhoek,"Addis Ababa to Windhoek with Ethiopian Airlines. One of the worst customer service experience ever encountered. On 7th November, 14 people missed a flight from Addis Ababa to Gabone/Windhoek because there was no bus driver on the bus that we were told to board. A driver finally came 5-10 minutes later, but he had no clue where the airplane was and simply drove us in a circle around the airport before arriving back at the departure gate. It took 30 more minutes for them to admit that the plane had already left as the airline does not have policy of counting passengers in the plane. Ground staff/customer service agents also admitted to their mistake. We have booked 2 Ethiopian Airlines flights and both times this has happened. The first time we got lucky as more than 20+ people got stuck in the airport in Zanzibar for a flight from Zanzibar to Addis Ababa. This time we were not so lucky. Compensation for more than a day and a half of lost time, hotel bookings and lost meetings? Initial offer: Nothing except an economy class re-booking on a later flight about 15 hours later. Subsequent offer: After much haggling a $300 voucher or $150 cash even though we had asked what is considered a reasonable request of $200 cash. However, two things to note about the offer. First no passengers were able to get the cash in Addis Ababa as the customer service officers claimed to not have cash on hand. Second the voucher is less valuable than the cash as you must buy the tickets through the airline ticket office which is often at least $150 higher than any ticket you would buy online. The customer service also used a stalling tactic by handing us off from one officer to the next. After 9 hours of waiting an agent finally came that told us they would come back within 10 minutes so that people could receive their cash and concerns would be addressed. However, no one showed up for another few hours giving only a half hour before boarding in which they claimed that there was no cash available because they do not handle money. One last thing to note is that of the 12 passengers that were routed to Windhoek (Namibia) via Johannesburg from Addis Ababa 4 of these passengers did not board the early morning flight on Air Namibia flight that Ethiopian Airlines had said they had booked from Johannesburg to Windhoek. Upon arrival at the transit desk the officer for Air Namibia stated that the tickets were either not booked or canceled. In the end the customer service people aggravated 14 customers who likely now will try to avoid flying Ethiopian Airlines whenever possible.

Its a disgrace that they operate the wheelchair service by not having a proper lift for the elderly passengers. The lounge was THE WORSE I have ever seeing.

Nov,2016.0,Ethiopian Airlines a Surprise,London,Durban International Economy,"There are not many options available to fly to Durban South Africa with only 1 stop and, in the past, I have flown Emirates via Dubai, so when I saw that Ethiopian Airlines were flying there via Addis Ababa I decided to give it a try. I was a little nervous but the very competitive price of £500 return was a decider. I was pleasantly surprised. The 2 aircraft I flew on were new, with good seating and ample leg room (far better than Emirates). The in flight service was a little below par due, I think, to the fewer number of cabin crew who were very polite. The food was average and for those that like an alcoholic drink they don't serve spirits - only beer and wine. Addis Ababa airport was an experience and subject to another review! The other plus was the 46kgs baggage allowance! Very good value for money and I will fly with them again.",3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

The cabins are always clean and functioning. The cabin crew are always on hand and courteous. Food quality is good and has been recently given a make over, improving things a little more. The area that lets the travel experience down is the airport in Addis Ababa. Bike International is not one of the most luxurious airports so if you have a long transit time it may be slightly uncomfortable.

Staff met us with a glas of Champagne ( as normal in Biz Clas ). Seats was good, but they are not a flat bed, so when your try to sleep, you are sliding slowly down to the bottom and it's not good at all. For me that is 195cm tall, well it was no idea at all to have it all the way down, as my feet was ""crushed"" a bit and also the sliding. So half sitting up, was the best way. So not the best experiance. Food and wine was quite good, not the best - but very good. Wines as well. Staff made their best to take care of us. Breakfast, after the stop in Vienna, was average and not more. Also the stop in Vienna, took away some ""sleeping time"".

First from TLV to ADD, I booked a flight to Addis Ababa and due to the riots decided to take another flight directly to Nairobi with Kenya airways. When I got to ADD I went straight to see that the baggage will be transferred to my flight to Nairobi (they had 5 hours for that), and been told that it's okay, and nothing to worry about, just to go rest somewhere. An hour and a half before flight I went to check again, just to make sure my baggage is okay, in Ethiopian airlines counter no one was willing to help, just making false calls to baggage claim and sending them an email. When I found Kenya airways they told me that my baggage was found and on the plane, so I calmed down, but when I was boarding they told me it wasn't found yet. Had to go to Nairobi, wait for my baggage, since no one went to look for it when my flight from Tel Aviv arrived. I got the bag 22 hours after just enough to cause a lot of inconvenience and time wasting, and not enough to get compensation. ""Perfect timing"". Second flight: ADD to TLV on November 14th 2016, the itinerary in my reservation was 15:10 flight leaves and 18:50 arrives in TLV. In fact it left on 16:45 and arrived in 20:25 without acknowledging me that there was a change! Because of not telling me, I spent more 90 minuets in the airport for no need, and my family members had to wait for more than 90 min, something that could have been easily avoided with prior acknowledgment.

My friend and I bought quite a complex itinerary starting from Rome to Entebbe via Addis Abeba; then from Kigali Rwanda to Blantyre Malawi via Addis; and then back to Rome. We purchased Economy tickets which we then decided to upgrade to Business class, paying the difference. All lags were confirmed and the full price had been charged to our credit cards but when we arrived at the counters something did not work out and although the staff could see that we were in Business class, somehow they were unable to issue the corresponding boarding pass. We were left at the beck and call of the manager on duty in the various airports: some of them were cooperative and overrid the system to issue the boarding pass; on one occasion we were made to fly economy (!!!!) and have been upgraded on board but at that point we had lost the other privileges of business class such as priority for our bags and the use of the lounge. In each and every airport we had to spend at least one hour for check in because of this system failure and felt that some ground staff could not care less and did not want to take responsibility. Myself, as a paying passenger, feel that whatever problem they had, they should have solved it since they encountered no problem at all charging my credit card.

When the flight attendants started serving meals around the cabin flight, I was advised that they could not provide a meal for my son until they had served all the other passengers on the flight who had paid for their tickets.

However, flight schedule was changed several times before I even went to the airport. Even at airport, gates frequently changed and transport to plane was by delayed buses. Cheap prices, average food, but older planes with no individual seat screens. Addis Abba airport badly in need of upgrade. First to have sleeper seats but old and crowded. A few shops selling Chinese goods in US dollars. Wanted to shower and change in washrooms after several overnight flights - too crowded to do so. Basement was pitch dark and freezing cold (exposed to the elements). Toilet was a temporary trailer with porta-potties. Strong smell and windows open so everyone in lounge can see and hear you. Supposedly loading by zones but first zone called and no other - everyone just queued up to get on helter-skelter. One problem was that they did not load the disabled first - one women had to get out of her wheelchair and queue up with regular passengers at plane entrance to get to her seat. Naturally, this was difficult for her and slow. Why they did not follow other airline's policies and load the disabled and families with small kids first is beyond me. They certainly saved no time in doing so and caused great stress to the disabled as many had limited mobility.",3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,AirlineQuality
Dec,2016.0,"incompetent, rude and unhelpful",Dubai,Durban,"Dubai to Durban via Addis Ababa. This was the worst experience I have ever had on an airline. The flight from Dubai to Addis Ababa was set to arrive in Addis at 07h55. The boarding time was 07h45 and the plane departed at 08h30. Based on these times alone, it was an impossibility that we would catch the connecting flight - they could not give us a reason for the late departure. My husband and I (and many other passengers) expressed their concern to cabin crew that we would not make our connecting flights. We were assured that the captain had communicated with ground staff and that our plane was waiting for us. We arrived in Addis and were escorted to a bus. We were then told to stand in a queue. When we asked why we were in a queue and not boarding our plane we were stared at blankly. We (and about 30 other people) soon realised that the planes that were ""waiting for us"" had all departed. We finally got to the front of the queue after waiting for about 50 minutes and were told we would just have to wait until the flight the next day. This was Christmas Eve. After much argument, my husband turned on his roaming and found a flight that day. The people behind us piped up and said they also wanted that flight. The staff grabbed all our passports into a bundle and came back with two tickets for the people who had pushed in front of us and said they only had two tickets so we would have to wait until the next day! The staff were incompetent, rude and unhelpful. We stood there for about 2 hours trying to get them to help us. They would go and hide in the corner so they didn't have to help us. When the manager finally arrived he was unapologetic and incompetent. When we complained that we couldn't only get to Durban late on Christmas eve instead of on 23rd they said ""well then you can fly on Christmas day"". We asked about compensation for our car hire and hotel in Durban that we were missing and were laughed at. The gentleman in front of us was offered another flight on 26 December. We ended up having to stay in Addis overnight and take 2 connecting flights to get to Durban on the evening of Christmas Eve. They took another hour to find our luggage for the ""hotel"". The hotel they put us in was dirty, had power cuts, the elevator didn't work and hotel staff walked into our room 3 times without so much as a knock saying ""oh, I thought you had left"" or ""oh, someone is in here"". The bathroom had cockroaches and we were given no monetary compensation. The way that Ethiopian Airlines staff treated us was the worst part, as if it was a joke that we were missing precious time with our families. I tried to call Ethiopian Airlines in South Africa on about 8 different numbers to cancel our return flight and get a refund. The numbers either cut out or just rang. I eventually had to turn on roaming and called the Ethiopia office. I was put on hold for 30 minutes and then told he couldn't help me and I should call South Africa. I told him that no one answers and he said he didn't know then. We physically went into the office in Cape Town and canceled our return flights on 28 December 2016. We are still waiting for the refund! Addis Ababa airport is dirty and disgusting. The toilets are worse than festival toilets and their duty free doesn't have working card machines. I complained at first that Emirates were too expensive but now realise that you get what you pay for. You couldn't pay me to fly Ethiopian airlines again, the worst airline.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality
Dec,2016.0,travelling thru Addis Ababa is a challenge,Juba,Stockholm,"Juba to Stockholm via Addis Ababa. I choose Ethiopian Airlines when I get a reasonable ticket price, as I find travelling via Addia Ababa can be a bit of a challenge. This trip started in Juba, South Sudan that is an airport of itself, not an easy one to travel through. I checked in day before and got for the first leg the seat 27C, only to find out on board there was only 25 rows. However there was empty seats so no big deal. The catering on the flight tough was a real disappointment, before we used to get a decent sandwich and a dink service. This time it was a box containing a napkin, a small bottle of water and a minimal piece of bread. No drink trolley was seen. To their advantage we departed 30 minutes early tough. Next leg Juba to Stockholm as at 2355 and i had a good 4 hours in Addis to spend the time. Gate on my boarding pass was shown as number 9 but on the airport screens I could read number 12. Closer to the departure I went towards gate 12 but me and a number of fellow passengers for the flight was shown to gate 10. So after security check I went to gate 10 but was told to proceed to gate 12 via a locked glass door 'somebody will open it later'. After some time we were some 50+ people waiting for the door to be opened when a ground staff came and directed us to gate 1 in the other end of the terminal in the basement. The basement area was almost pitch black (no power), and gate 1 was already full of people, but I heard a voice in the darkness calling Rome and Stockholm passengers to go to gate 6. The confusion was close to a Jacque Tati movie but at the same time I found it quite amusing. Others did not. Eventually we boarded and the flight departed only some 30 minutes late to Stockholm via Rome. Flight was close to full on both sectors, service good and food acceptable. And to my surprise we arrived Stockholm 30 minutes early so I guess there is some margin in the schedule. Generally I find their cabin crew quite good and accommodating, Food between bad and average but travelling thru Addis Ababa is really a challenge at times. The company should have improved Bole transit and departure areas long time ago, as it can be a real struggle passing thru. I can recommend Ethiopian Airlines to experienced and somewhat hardened travelers that do not expect what the commercials are telling you. It can be really okay, but also be quite of a roller coaster. If the price is right I may go for ET again, but if I get a better competitor for a similar price the option is obvious. If you are a first time traveler to Africa you may think twice about the flight options.",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

I also asked for special food but we where only given the food when we were going to Addis from Rome.On the other flights, the special food was not provided. My son does not like the spices that are put in the food so he could just not eat. I bought a ticket online for my maid who failed to join me on the trip. I was told at the airport that I could not get any refund since I bought the ticket online. I did not know that, online booking has such disadvantages. I think it is good to inform the passenger just before the payment is made. I was so disappointed.",4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Dec,2016.0,Disappointing deterioation in service,London,Harare International Economy,"This was a very disappointing experience for me having once used and had a good in flight experience with Ethiopian airlines. This was the second time since my first review that I used Ethiopian airlines. The check in service was very poor, it was a real scrum in the airport and we felt like so many cattle being herded about. The line was atrociously long. They really need to operate more desks for flights with such numbers. Onboard I was seated on my return journey adjacent to a thoroughly unpleasant couple, the woman in the couple removed her shoes and elevated one of her feet on the armrest adjacent to me. They became rude and belligerent when I asked an air attendant to ask the woman to remove her foot, and the air attendant did absolutely nothing about it ,other than giggle and chat to them in their language. The transfer situation in Addis for the Addis to Harare leg and back was abysmal. Large numbers of people were crammed into a relatively small space for all of the regional flights. There was only one information screen that I could find and it was not operating properly. There was no seating. No clock. The escalator didn't work and I witnessed a mother with a baby and baby bags negotiating the stalled escalator with no help from the airport staff and us passengers had to come to her aid. There was no lift leading to the transfer area either and a man in a wheelchair was to be carried rather ignominiously down the stalled escalator. He looked absolutely mortified and so embarassed. The toilets on flight from Addis to Harare were shocking, stank of urine, and clearly hadn't been properly cleaned in a while. Really Ethiopian airlines treat their regional neighbours as if they have no value. I would strongly suggest that people flying this route say stuff the higher baggage allowance and stuff Ethiopian airlines, and choose a better, 'professional' alternative to them. This was an abysmal service and an atrocious experience never to be repeated.",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

As an airline, you feel that there is effort made to ensure the overall experience is both efficient but enjoyable. Staff are kind, polite, friendly and attentive. The overall experience and service is professional. The quality of the plane and its facilities are well maintained and the in flight entertainment is good. The in flight meals are well thought through and tasty and work well for dietary requirements. I had a flight which had an overnight stopover in Ethiopia, organised by the airline. I was impressed how they managed the whole transition so well. They sorted out the overnight visa quickly, moved us into a hotel with meals and picked us up the next morning- the whole experience was smooth and the hotel was fairly good.

Have been with family to all continents except Antarctica- so we know long haul. We had 2 different aircraft. IAD to ADD was an older aircraft retrofitted with seatback entertainment. Seats were the ""old fashioned"" super cushioned kind with footrest - comfortably fitting my 6'3"" husband. But they were retrofitted with seatback entertainment. Out of date style, but up there with Emirates comfort. I'll take it. We were ""overfed"" - - it seemed as though they were keeping us entertained with meals and snacks. Choices limited and fairly bland, but well prepared. But my growing teenage son was actually full on airline food - he ate it and it was enough quantity. ADD airport is not pleasant. Make sure you have bottled water or some other safe liquid before you deplane. The ""within Africa"" transit area has no food or drink and the restroom facilities are horrible. ADD to KIL was on their ""Queen of Sheba"" new aircraft. Short flight, great seats, updated but kept the older configuration of fewer seats/more space, and we were fed....again....on a 2 hour flight. Kids still prefer Emirates for the perks (snack packs, kids toys, balloon animals created for them) - - but we were comfortable, ate, slept, and were entertained for almost 24 hours just fine.",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,TripAdvisor

The flights were comfortable, the food was up to the standard of the best I have had on flights. The in flight entertainment could be improved to give a wider selection but I did have quite enough to watch and listen to. The airport at Addis Abababa was akin to a cattle market - but even so they managed to herd all the passengers for the many flights quite efficiently. Toilets basic, clean and plenty of loo paper. They were busy with renovations so I'll be interested to see the progress in a few months. Stop overs are kept to a minimum and the entire flight from Cape Town to London was many hours shorte than Emirates who I usually fly with. I would definitely recommend them and will be flying with them again. Best value for money flights at the moment.

(apparently works with a gel that between the two sheets of glass and electrical current - very impressive) Flying out of Cape Town, the air hostesses looked liked they'd seen better days...maybe short staffed, who knows. They seemed a bit wrecked. Food was mostly edible depending on the leg of the journey, and for the ticket prices we paid, I wasn't expecting Michelin stars anyway.

Dec,2016.0,Never again,Johannesburg,London International Economy,"I will not recommend flying with Ethiopian Airlines to anyone. Some of the tv screens weren't working on our flight. The service was very slow and after two and a half hours, since they've started, when the food and drink trolley finally got to us, they only had the vegetarian option available, the flight back they also ran out of food. Our stopover of 5 hours at Bole airport in Addis Ababa was an absolute nightmare. It's such a small airport with so many people, we walked around for 2 hours to finally get a seat. You can also not go through boarding gates before an hour before your flight, and may I add there are more seats available through the boarding gates! Also, no wifi on the airport! The bathrooms on the airport were dirty with no toilet paper! People are also standing around smoking inside the airport! When eventually you go through boarding gates, the staff are unfriendly, impatient and treat you like a criminal. It's also absolutely chaos when boarding a plane. They try to board certain seats first, but there's no control and they board the plane from front and the back, which causes people to be stuck in the pathways as some needs to get to the front of the plane and others at the back, so we all have to squeeze past everyone. We couldn't do an online check in 36 hours before our departure for our return flight, it kept on saying we have to visit an Ethiopian Airline office.

Dec,2016.0,mid-afternoon fight from HKG to ICN,Hong Kong,Seoul North Asia Economy,"Took off from HKG around 14:35 and landed at ICN around 19:25. The flight was en route to ICN from ADD, so I was expecting the boarding queue in HKG to be relatively short. Turned out I was wrong. Maybe everyone de-planed at HKG for lunch and boarded again, but the boarding at the gate was packed and the aircraft was full. Check-in and boarding went smoothly enough. Onboard, the seats were relatively wide (9 abreast, on a B787). Service was fine. The food was a bit bland: not sure if it was the re-stocked airplane food from HKG or food direct out of ADD. AVOD had an interesting mix of Western, Asian, African materials. No AVOD box under seat to chip into your leg-room. Weak link was toilet cleanliness --- or at least it was with the one toilet I used; it was a little wet inside. Price was attractive: about HKD 1300 (total, incl. taxes, etc) one-way HKG-ICN looked as if the airline did not charge the higher flexible economy rates on my booking even though I was only flying one-way with it. And this flight was just two days after Christmas Day, so technically it was high season. Of course, being in transit flight, the scheduling is not for everyone. If you want to arrive in Korea at night (the flight may land around 19:25, but by the time you get past immigration & customs & baggage & airport rail into downtown Seoul, it should be past 21:30 -- so realistically, by the time you are in town, you either jump straight into nightlife or get to rest early), then this is a good option to think about. But if you want to land around 05:00 and start your day in the morning (to get to work/sights straightaway or to save the cost of a night of accommodation), then if memory serves only Korean Air offers the midnight departure from HKG to land around 05:00 in ICN). Also, this flight is not offered every day of the week. About 1 week before check-in, the airline sent pro forma email asking whether passenger would like to bid for their business class seat. The idea did strike a chord with me, but the minimum bid was USD 180 -- that's already more than what I paid for the entire seat with taxes, etc., included. If that was a last minute effort to sell unused business class seats, it's too costly ----- didn't give it another second's thought. One might have considered using miles to upgrade, but I belonged to another alliance airline's mileage program and, as far as I know, Star Alliance doesn't have a cross-airline use of each other's loyalty plan miles to upgrade on a partner airline flight.",5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

I was first in the line with Star Alliance gold, so what a pleasure it was to be told, you've been upgraded and then it being on the Dreamliner - I don't think the older planes would have given the same experience. That segment of the flight was magical made great by the hands on attentive staff.

I was on a connecting flight in KUL and the airport layout is such that not all international flights use the same terminal. I had to change terminals and rush in order to find Ethiopian Airlines but still got there an hour in advance of my flight. When I arrived at the counter there was a group of people arguing with the manager. He was not allowing them to check into their flight even though they were an hour in advance of the flight. I then had the same problem. There was PLENTY of time to check us in and let us board. I literally could not have gotten there sooner as my incoming flight had just arrived. The manager brushed me off to talk to their office in the morning for a refund and I had to get a hotel for the night. Fortunately the group in front of me DID appreciate other people and gave me a ride to the hotel and showed more consideration and care than this terrible airline. In the morning I went to the office the manager told me would be open.. and it was CLOSED. So I had to call back from Thailand to arrange a refund and afer several emails was informed there was a minimum $200 US dollar fee for a refund .. my ticket was $150. So NO REFUND.

Dec,2016.0,"OK if you have no extraordinary needs, but don't expect any ""out of the box"" responses",Washington DC,Addis Ababa International Economy,"I am a Sheba Miles GOLD member (Star Alliance GOLD). One time I fell on the bridgeway to the aircraft in Washington, D.C., because the duty free cart was blocking the access. I injured my knee and requested to be upgraded to business class, but there was NO ONE who had the authority to respond to such a request. Three years later, I still have problems with my knee because of a 15-hour flight in economy class, when there were empty seats in Business class. I wrote a three-page letter complaining about the inability of the staff to respond to my situation, but have never received a reply. On a recent trip, I needed to change my ticket because of the death of my father, and was requesting a compassionate, bereavement response to waive the change fee. I asked to speak to the ticket agent supervisor, and he yelled at me that he wasn't going to play that game and would not tell me who his supervisor was. Then, he hung up on me. Imagine how non-GOLD miles members must be treated. If you have no special needs or extraordinary situations, the airline will eventually get you from Point A to Point B, though within Africa, they operate their airline like a bus service. If the plane is not full, they will combine it with another flight. You will be delayed at least two hours while they change the flight plan, re-fuel for additional stops, and load additional luggage. I have taken unplanned tours of many East African airports without any explanation or apology on the part of the airline. The flight attendants are not briefed, so they cannot assuage customers of their concerns about why they have landed in an airport not on their itinerary. If your flight is delayed reaching Addis Ababa and you miss your connecting flight, you will spend hours in a very chaotic line trying to get rebooked on another flight and to get hand-written hotel and meal vouchers. Then, you will likely wait for another two hours for the bus to take you to a mediocre hotel while you wait for your rebooked flight. I call them Ethiopian ""just wait"" Airlines. Airline personnel will not tell you what is going on, but will tell you, ""Just wait."" Unfortunately, travelers within Africa do not have very many options, and Ethiopian Airlines bets on the fact that you will just put up with their poor customer service. We long for the day of more travelers within Africa that can increase competition so customer service has to improve. All I can say is, ""Buyer, Beware!""",3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Dec,2016.0,Never again!!!!! I feel conned.,London,Nairobi International Economy,"I had read a mixture of reviews about this airline. I travel all around the world and have used most airlines. My story starts in London Heathrow. I was visiting family and my luggage weight was 'Spot on'. I have my own personal scales and am always very careful about weight. I was suprised at 'Check in' when they weighed my hand luggage (a bag 7kg) and a laptop case (5kg). I was within the permitted weight and continued through to departures. There I bought a camera for my daughter, a book for myself and a bottle of water for the flight. I went to the gate, and boarding commenced. Just I was about to the board the aircraft and in the final stages (when you give in your boarding card and leave the gate) my hand luggage was weighed again. It was 2.5 Kg overweight. The water must of weighed 1kg. I was asked to pay £60 for the excess. Not impressed, what a con........ I did notice lots of other people with tons of bags from the duty free, all of which appeared of Etheopian origin, and they walked straight through. I argued the point, but it got no where and I was forced to pay the excess baggage. I NEVER say this, but I feel I was racially selected and it certainly felt that way. No where does it say you cannot purchase duty free, and I did not abuse it either. You can buy duty free on the plane, spirit and wine and that's OK. I do not know any other airline that does this - Dreadful. When on the aircraft I saw a man probably Etheopian, and he had 3 or 4 bags from the duty free (well it is Christmas and gifts for his family). I asked him if he had been stopped and he told me he had not. It was very upsetting especially as I am always so careful. I could have disposed of the water and the book, but the camera was far too expensive to do that. It is such a shame as the rest of the journey was good. The aircraft was a Dreamliner, and very spacious and comfortable. It was a night flight, so I was not interested in food or cabin crew attention, but it seemed acceptable. My daughter has just moved to Nairobi, so I will be travelling that route frequently. It's not good Etheopian Airlines, I will never consider your flights again!",5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,TripAdvisor

Dec,2016.0,Horrendously disorganised when facing mishap,Mombasa,Addis Ababa Africa Economy,"Plane had technical failure so pilot decelerated sharply when we were going down the runway just before take-off. All of us passengers are grateful that safety was a priority here. But what ensued was just a stressful nightmare. There was only a single staff member at hand, who did his best to lay out what he knew professionally. Unfortunately, it was disappointing that any updates were drip-fed so slowly to us. One would think that there should be a protocol in place to deal with such mishaps, but it was clearly not the case for this airline. We waited in utter uncertainty for 3 hours before being informed the flight was cancelled as spare part couldn't arrive on time. SInce it was an early evening flight, we were told dinner would be provided but this did not materialise. Without any coordination and announcement to all passengers in a clear manner, we were told to pick up bags and get into buses which would bring us to a hotel for the night. It was only through incessant calls to the hotel reception after this that we knew what time we were supposed to meet the next day for our flight. Next day, check in was a nightmare too. They ordered over a bigger plane to fit all of us from the night before plus those on the day's flight. They could have easily avoided the chaos by asking us to check in earlier. This was made doubly chaotic when the staff member did not explain news to everyone but to just a small group, which made everyone overly anxious and queues became completely scrambled. Another point I'm grateful for is that they covered connecting flights, but again, this could have been communicated earlier and clearer to avoid undue stressing. The much better option here would be to get a new flight later in the same evening, so many of us would not miss our connecting flights. Even in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia wjhich should be HQ, communications to passengers was not any better. The new flight was delayed 2 hrs, and so I missed my next Ethiopian airline flight to Dubai. Only the person at the departure gate could tell me for certain that I could take the next flight. No one in between had a clue or professional courtesy to allay any uncertainties.

Meals are not really business class standard, and one of the 3 main dishes was not available on the Bangkok-Addis flight. The wine list is good, with some interesting and very exotic Ethiopian wines. Service was good, friendly and efficient. Seating on the 787 is standard 2-2-2 with full reclining sats, the cabin decoration non-existent.

Addis Ababa to London the A350 was superior to Boeing 787. The only better seating setup I've experience is Qatar, easily better than Emirates business class seat. Addis Ababa transfer was quick and efficient. Lounge in Addis is basic but food was nice and it's clean and functional. All in all, Ethiopian Airways was half price of Emirates, Qatar and BA on same route. In most areas it's marginally below Emirates and Qatar but in some areas it's better (A350 is nicer set-up than Emirates 777, for example). On balance it's about 10-20% below Emirates, still excellent, but it's half the price. Overall very impressed, will fly Ethiopian again.",4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,AirlineQuality
Jan,2017.0,unexpected 24 hour visit to Ethiopia,Kinshasa,Washington DC,"Kinshasa to Washington Dulles via Addis Ababa and Dublin. My Ethiopian Airlines flight departed Kinshasa 4 hours late and arrived at Addis Ababa 11:30 pm (local time) with hundreds of others passengers and no organized arrangements ready for us. Waited 2 hours and after getting a hotel voucher, I had to argue and demand my checked bag back for my unexpected 24 hour visit to Ethiopia. I was sent outside the airport at 2am (alone) with luggage to look for a hotel van that was not there but there were lots of locals trying to get me into their cabs. After 40 mins waiting, airline staff finally came outside and sent me to a different hotel whose van was there. Most passengers on this flight left their homes early in the morning in Kinshasa because it usually takes 3 hours to get to the airport from downtown in order to check in 2 hours before the flight. We were finally served a tuna sandwich and warm soda 3 hours after our scheduled departure time in the waiting area of the airport. 3 hours later and nearly 10 hours after leaving my home that morning I was finally given a meal on the plane with warm soda and no ice. According to the staff, the ice melted due to the delay and there was no ice for the entire flight to ADD. I hope this gives you a better understanding of the level of fatigue I had when we arrived at nearly midnight and that every minute of delay at the airport made things more difficult. I have never eaten dinner at 3 am in a hotel before. Returned to airport for my new flight home and my name was flagged for secondary security check where they proceeded to go through every item in my luggage and purse taking everything out (for the entire waiting area to see all of my personal belongings without any privacy). Of course I protested and demanded a supervisor who tried to blame the screening on the US government. I am a U.S. Diplomat and there were many of us on that flight. So when they tell me that the US government picked my name for secondary inspection - I am very qualified to know that was not a true statement.

Quite a pleasant flight in economy on Boeing 787, I was impressed with the meals - first time I've had Salmon as dinner. Quite the opposite in the older Boeing 767 used in Africa. One thing that struck me was the inattentiveness of the staff. Several passengers requested assistance by pressing the button during the flight but I never saw a single being attended to. I requested assistance but after ten minutes decided to walk into the galley myself to get something to drink. The thing that really is bad with Ethiopian is the transfer in Addis Ababa. This is one of the worst Airports I have been to and it really needs an upgraded terminal. A delayed flight by two hours in Addis Ababa with no information, quoted by pilot as being caused by Aircraft rotation, is also one reason I'm probably not using Ethiopian again.",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

Boeing 787s which already look worn (broken seat parts) even though they're modern with unresponsive IFE touch screens and a limited amount of entertainment. I heard that Ethiopian Airlines opened a brand new catering facility but they still serve the same awful tomato chicken and rice and industrial breakfasts with bright pink sausages. Such a shame for an airline that could represent Ethiopia's incredible culinary tradition. No inflight magazine available on any flight and night kits randomly distributed to a few passengers only - same goes for pillows and blankets. Boarding disorganized and chaotic with no separate line for Star Gold/Business class passengers. Bole airport is worse than ever with filthy toilets, overcrowded boarding areas and no wifi. The only nice thing is that both flights were on time, which is good enough. I have flown Ethiopian Airlines at least once a month in the past 3 years and despite its aggressive marketing campaigns, it provides a subpar service and is still decades behind its competitors in Africa such as Qatar Airways, Etihad, Emirates and Turkish Airlines.",2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,AirlineQuality

The free seating out of NSI went without issue. In business class, great service. Very attentive FA. Only about 6 pax in the whole cabin so we were pampered. I slept all the way after the meal until landing.

They are obviously so proud of their nation - that comes across in their service. I had a very tight connection in Addis - just 35mins. We landed and I was on the connecting plane in 15 mins! That is because they want it to happen. As the plane land came to a stop the stairs pulled up, the coach arrived and someone asked where you were connecting to. Whisked away on the coach to be met in the terminal by someone else asking where we were going. She asked me to wait to one side and then took me directly to the Cape Town plane in seconds - everyone else had already boarded and I took my seat.

Jan,2017.0,Charges for Weighed Duty Free at London Heathrow!!,Dublin,Harare International Economy,"Dear, sir madam, We fly to Zimbabwe regularly, as I have a sister living there, so have flown with many airlines. This was our second time using and flying with Ethiopian Airlines and we were once again very satisfied with this airline, Addis Ababa airport has much improved since last year and they are building, a very busy hub. We like their new planes and they are roomy. We love the airlines varied flight schedules, arrival and connecting times, friendly staff and of course price, the online facility to book special meal requirements and seats and to keep track of our flights, the emails from Ethiopian Airlines before and during our trip keeping us up to-date with the flight schedules and we will definitely use Ethiopian Airlines again, but not out of London Heathrow!! Our generous 2X23kg cases per person hold luggage, was checked all the way through to Zimbabwe from Dublin and all arrived safely. This year we encountered a problem when boarding our Addis Ababa connecting flight from London Heathrow. We haven't used London Heathrow for many years as it is quite busy and it can be difficult to get a flight that allows enough time to get our connection, or else one must wait hours for the connecting flight. When we arrived at the boarding gate at London Heathrow, ALL and I mean ALL of our hand luggage was weighed at the boarding gate. Our Carry on cases, my hand bag and rucksack for my husband and our Duty Free purchases!! Luckily I wasn't over weight, but because of the weighing of the Duty Free which my husband was carrying, he was deemed to be overweight and fined £40 sterling!! When we queried why ALL of the hand luggage and the Duty Free were being weighed, we were roughly informed that we could purchase the Duty Free, but they were weighing everything, no other explanation was offered, despite several queries by myself and my husband. As the flight was boarding we had no option but to pay up, a real pressure situation. If we had left our Duty Free behind then we would still be down money. Really put a damper on the start of our trip. Now I haven't encountered this weighing (of everything) with any other airline that we have flown with before and last year on our way to Zimbabwe with Ethiopian Airlines we flew through Frankfurt and didn't have our hand luggage/Duty Free weighed for the Addis Ababa flight from there or other the connections? Also this year on our return journey from Harare to Addis Ababa to Dublin, no weighing of any Hand Luggage or Duty Free at any airport. Needless to say we were not happy with being charged £40 sterling, through no fault of ours, at no stage in the Airport or when purchasing the Duty Free were we informed that it would form part of our cabin weight allowance. When we returned home we looked on the Ethiopian Airlines web site about weighing ALL hand luggage with the Duty Free and couldn't find any reference to this practice. So we don't know if it was a money making exercise by Heathrow or Ethiopian Airlines at this airport? So let this weighing of ALL hand luggage and Duty Free be a warning to other travelers going through London Heathrow, and flying with Ethiopian Airlines. Also double check if it is now policy by London Heathrow to weigh ALL the hand luggage plus Duty Free purchases of passengers with every Airline leaving this airport? We will not be going through Heathrow again!!",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

The service were exceptionally slow and after two and a half hours, since they've started, when the food and drink trolley finally got to us, they only had the vegetarian option available, and on the trays itself there was not the regular rolls or a salad. Our stopover of 5 hours at Bole airport in Addis Ababa were an absolute nightmare. It's such a small airport with so many people passing through that it feels as if you have won the lotto of you just get a seat. You can also not go through boarding gates before an hour before your flight, and may I add there's more seats available through the boarding gates. So you have to walk around small teeny weeny shops and two restaurants which only take American Dollars as payment! Also, off course, no wifi on the airport! The bathrooms on the airport were dirty and stuffy, with not even toilet paper! People are also standing around smoking inside the airport! When eventually you go through boarding gates, the staff are unfriendly, impatient and treat you like a criminal. It's also absolutely chaos when boarding a plane. They try to board certain seats first, but there's no control and they board the plane from front and the back, which causes people to be stuck in the pathways as some needs to get to the front of the plane and others at the back.

They did not communicate until the very last moment that myself and two others would be left off. In fact, customer service promised me there would be a seat when they printed me a ticket that said standby for a flight I had booked 5 weeks previous. The compensation of $150 credit and a ok hotel was not enough for this loss. Why would they not ask for volunteers when they new they were oversold? Horrible airline. Bad business policy.

First plane (to Addis) 767 was old and dilapidated, seats are showing the wear and tear, are not typical lie flat biz class seats but more like regular seats but bigger and with extra legroom. 10 hour flight with NO entertainment - in biz class! No TVs, just those on the ceiling or wall which show the route of the plane. They handed out food menus but didn't have anything on the menu. I was served a chicken dish which was very dubious as to its freshness (the meat was gray) but I was starving, not much choice. Breakfast omelet prior to arrival was ok. Business class amenity kits don't have lip balm or moisturizer like most airlines do. Since I had expected the usual kit, I did not bring any with me and my lips cracked from dryness. Cloud 9 lounge in Addis has terrible internet and while the food there was ok on the way out, coming back, it was terrible. Flight to Bangkok was in the newer Dreamliner 787, much nicer, almost flat seats, food still not as per menu. TVs on this flight, but choice of movies very limited. Best part - wide drink list which is largely available on both flights. The staff were nice and attentive. Return trip, CIP lounge in BKK is terrible. Hardly any food, limited drink options, no where to charge your electronics unless you want to sit in the business center. Return flights were largely the same, newer plane out of BKK to ADD but still, not terribly clean, same movies as on the way out (remember limited choice - they could have had other movies in the opposite direction)....ADD-BKO-DKR older plane and no entertainment.

On this flight we met fellow passenger Mo Farah who couldn't have been nicer. The flight crew were fantastic and I was placed at the back of the business class with my husband located in the first row in economy class so it was easy for him to go back and forth and they had no problem about him sitting in the seat beside me for meals.

Had to re-book my hotel accommodation in Addis and spent hours in chaotic ques. Staff was clueless about rectifying my booking errors and this led to a chain reaction of crazy events. On arrival Visa issuance was dramatic - unhappy officers. Airport security a menace. Taxi/Hotel Shuttle staff outside Bole very problematic (be wary of your belongings) - spent nearly two hours waiting for the hotel shuttle to leave the parking lot as the drivers took their time to negotiate and exchange passengers like toys. Got booked into a dingy hotel (by EA booking agent) after being told it had a 5 star rating. Skipping all the mess in between - my flight from Addis to CT was probably the worst until arrival. Fast forward to luggage, my bags had been broken into (cling wrapping removed), bags were unlocked with sharp instruments and they stole lots of my stuff. EA airport staff management didn't want to take any responsibility and fingers were pointed back to Addis Ababa. Terrible experience. But as much as l would like to give EA another chance, l think l will take a little break for now and might reconsider my options at a latter stage.

Feb,2017.0,Fantastic Airline,Los Angeles,Dublin International Economy,"When Ethiopian Airlines first appeared on the scene with non-stop flights to Ireland from Los Angeles I thought, finally, an airline that repsonds to passengers needs. Prior to EA providing this vital service the only other option was a two-flight trip. In terms of time saved, taking Ethiopian Airlines gives you back an entire day that is lost when taking two flights. Taking the two-flight option means an in-terminal wait between flights, having to go through Security again to access your second flight and then the very real possibility with how over-crowded that service is, that you will be delayed and miss your connection. In real terms, taking Ethiopian Airlines gets you there in one approx. 11-hour flight, the two-flight option starts at 16/17 hours and only goes up depending on how long your wait is between flights. With the two-flight option you have very little control as to which airports you fly into and out off, often going far off the beaten path, flying for needless miles just to connect in another city. Ethiopian Airlines takes all of that away, their planes are comfortable, space overhead is roomy, their in-flight entertainment is free and offers lots of choices and they give you beer and wine for free with dinner. Since I started flying with them to Ireland I can't go back to the two-flight haul. Now, I only fly with Ethiopian Airlines. Their prices are also very competitive.

At check in at Dublin Airport we mentioned we had a connecting flight and were told that they would hold the Cape town flight as there were 40 people on our delayed flight going to Cape town. On arrival in Addis we were met by ground staff who told us the Cape town flight was gone and we would be re routed through Johannesburg and there were no business seats left so we were given seats in economy but not together.

The Check-In is done by ANA Staff so everything went super smooth and in a very helpful and friendly manner. The flight arrived slightly late from Hongkong and Staff immediately apologized for the ""delay"" which was maybe 10min. So not really worth mentioning. Boarding took place almost on time and was very well organized. The seat was very comfortable and had a great amount of recline. The legroom was very good! Even with your seat fully reclined the person behind you had enough space. Every passenger had his pillow and blanket. The crew was a bit apathetically at the beginning. What was annoying was the fact, that they didn't turn down the cabin-lights during take-off and even the boarding music was playing throughout the first 30min of the flight non-stop. Food provided was EXCELLENT and more than enough for a 4.30h flight. Drinks (also beer and wine) were offered regularly. IFE on that first generation 787 was a bit outdated, the touchscreens were hardly responding. Thankfully there was a remote as well. Selection of movies, series and music was good.

Feb,2017.0,"Poor airport and in-flight experience, not worth the cost savings",Addis Ababa,Dublin International Economy,"The prices are quite good for the airline, which is why we used them. Airport: The ground staff at Addis are ok, though the airport toilets are a disgrace (bring paper and hand sanitiser!!). One of the staff hit my partners ankle with a trolley giving her a large bruise, without apologising. Duty free shops blatantly sell fake and used goods (mainly of electronics). We were told by the shop assistant the samsung phones (costing about $200) were fake, as were the beats headphones, and most other items there. Shops had no prices on most things, so you have to ask about everything. We wanted to buy spirits but were told that we couldn't as airport security would take them from us going to the gate (only certain flights are able to buy alcohol). In-flight: The air stewards were very sullen and really looked like they hate their job. My partner tried to ask the head steward (in full white outfit) a question, but before being able to say anything was sternly told ""I only deal with first class, so talk to someone else"", with no apology. She was standing at the back of the plane! A polite person should have said, ""I'm sorry I won't be able to help you myself, but this lady here will do her best to help. Thank you."" I asked later about buying something from the in-flight duty free, but was rudely told they didn't have it (she was almost annoyed I asked for it). The food was pretty average-to-bad. The snack was a dry bread roll with some luncheon type reformed spam meat. We couldn't eat it. Addis is a cool city, but the airline and airport need to improve before I would think of flying with them again.

Feb,2017.0,I cannot get any response about spoiled luggage.,Addis Ababa,Dublin International Economy,"To whom it may concern: This morning, 22/02/17 I’ve arrived to Dublin from Addis Ababa (Flight ET504) and received part of my checked-in luggage ‘in small pieces’. I have purchased 1 big(600) cartons of Marlboro Gold cigarettes and 1 bottle of Black Label whiskey in the Duty Free of Addis Ababa. Before I was allowed to board the plane, Duty Free purchases were taken off me by airport crew and I was told that this will be returned to me, together with my checked-in luggage in Dublin Airport. At the baggage belt of Dublin Airport, I was issued with a broken bottle of whiskey and wet cigarettes (destroyed). There was a big stain on the baggage belt underneath my bag with whiskey and cigarettes, which means that alcohol was damaged during transportation of check-in baggage to baggage belt by service workers in Dublin airport. Also I have to admit that whiskey bottle was ‘squished’ to many small pieces which means that extra force was used in order to destroy it (Usually Whiskey bottles are made from hard glass and in case if it breaks, it breaks as big glass pieces). I have addressed this issue to the plane captain and the flight attendants, approached the customs, contacted the Swissport, but wasn’t able to get any assistance.

Boarding was unfriendly, Business and Economy Class were treated the same. Ordered a special meal due to some food restrictions and was served food which I am not supposed to eat. Food presentation is poor, plated without any professionalism, just dumped on the plate and the food was not fresh. The main course was hard, fruits were spoiled. My neighbors seat was not properly functioning, my neighbor asked if she could use my charger. TV program and remote were not working property. In the bathroom the packets of paper tissues were still in the plastic wrap and they expected the business class passengers to open it. No proper amenities in the bathroom and soap dispenser was not working. Opted not to be disturbed for breakfast but they still woke me up. Requested four times for an additional Coca Cola Light and non of my requests were granted. The curtains was not closed between the galley and the cabin and the light shone into the cabin making it difficult to sleep.

Mar,2017.0,Disgusting Airline,Durban,Bangkok International Economy,"Ethiopian Arilines is the most disgusting and filthiest Airline I have come across in all my travel overseas. We were booked on the Dreamliner ET628 to Bangkok on the 28/12/16 but this did not happen, upon check-in we noticed that we would not be boarding the Dreamliner and our flight had changed, although our tickets indicated ET628. The aircraft was absolutely filthy, there was dirt on the floor, toilets were not cleaned, and toilet paper strewn on the floor, the cabin crew advised me that a child had just used the toilet and she did not get a chance to clean it. This is disgusting and unhygienic. On our attempted take off the aircraft could not take off due to electrical problems on the wings, we were asked to remain on the aircraft whilst they fixed the problem, this took 4 hours. There was another airline that had similar problems flying to Manila which could fly out of Addis Abba so instead, Ethiopian Airlines amalgamated both the airline passengers onto our flight, putting more lives at risk. Why did they not change airlines and put us on the flight that we were initially booked on. The food was just a disgusting as were the flight attendants attitude and the aircraft in total. Due to the problem being experienced on the aircraft I started to get heart palpation and my husband called the cabin crew, she took a full hour before she attended to me and then brought me Panado's lucky for me my husband managed to get my medication from my hand luggage and gave that to me. I lodged a complaint with my agent as well as Ethiopian Arilines. An upgrade was promised to me and my family by Karonie Ramsamy upon our return, email dated 9th January 2017 was sent to us, however Ethiopian Airline staff at the airport would not grant us that upgrade. My husband needed wheelchair assistance, this was not provided at all, both ways After arrival in South Africa I lodged an/other complaint and sent pictures to Adelahu Mengistu, who did nothing except offer my an upgrade on my next flight with Ethiopian Arilines.

Mar,2017.0,You get what you pay for....,London,Cape Town Central International Economy,"We found a cheap flight to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. A few weeks before the trip Ethiopian advised us there would be an additional stop in Botswana on the return trip. Cabin, seating and entertainment were average and slightly dated. Flight attendants didn't seem very attentive and on both directions we were only offered fish for our main meal. Both occasions I explained I have fish allergies and once they still forced the fish in front of me... removing it when I repeated my allergy issue. on both occasions a few minutes later the attendants arrived with chicken for me.... no explanation.... just delivered to me and disappeared! After collecting passengers in Botswana, a passenger defecated in the aisle of the plane. The crew were alerted of this and they commenced operation clean up which also included placing both (all) toilets in economy out of order for around 30 mins. Several passengers explained they MUST use the toilet and asked to use Business Class, but permission was denied. Stop over in Addis Ababa for several hours is not an enjoyable experience. The airport appears to be modern and architect designed, however the interior seems to have been placed inside with no consideration, tatty, dirty and generally a horrible environment to be in, especially when tired after a long flight. Overall after my experiences flying with Ethiopian Airlines I will not be foolish enough to take the cheapest flight again if with EA.

The food was Ok, compared to some horrible food served in other airlines. The stop in Adis Ababa Airport was a bit long (4 hours) but there are some sleeping chairs to chill out, bars where they serve tropical squeezed juices. In case you fall asleep, the staff of the airport come to the passengers waiting in the lounge to make sure they did not miss the last announcement for their flight departure. It is a quite busy airport as the main hub in East Africa. It is very interesting to see such a diversity of people from all over the world. The only thing that they could improve is the music they play on the plane when taking off and landing. It is too loud and very stressing (a solo piano with a kind of psycho melody).

Our fight was scheduled for August 2017 this was March 2017, then he noticed how stupid that was and put us on hold only to come back and tell us that our discounted fair was not a real price and so they would not honor our flights. They took our money, sent us the confirmation email for payment and flight details and now a few weeks later our flight is invalid they say but only after realizing the NO Show excuse wouldn't hold-up.. How is our flight not valid?! Ethiopian is a very dishonorable and poor business to have first falsely advertised their business then lie to our face just so they wouldn't have to honor our flight.

Also, I paid for both my tickets and have yet to get refunded, which I ultimately don't want because I still want to travel to both destinations.

They will give you more food if you ask for it (something I found out from someone sitting beside me). The earphones are also free so you can watch movies or shows, and there are enough entertainment to keep you occupied for the duration of the flight. The stewardess also passes out eye covers and tooth brush and blankets so it was a nice touch. What sets this airline back is there could be a chance that your screen malfunction, and you are stuck in a flight with no distractions. On my return flight, my wife table tray was broken so it didn't set properly. They did offer to change my wife's seat but it is still a minor inconvenience.

No in flight entertainment - few common screens leave passengers with no choice but to see what is being displayed. Most ports for earphones in the seats do not work.

Addis Ababa to Nairobi return flight on a tired 737 with torn seats and dysfunctional AC: the cabin was very hot throughout the flight and flight attendants just shrugged when told so. They even refused to provide a mother with a bassinet. Inedible food again - who serves cold shredded chicken with uncooked, bland rice and tomato sauce?

Was told I may need to move at CDG if seat taken by young child and then turfed out when 1 elderly passenger sat in middle of 3. No help offered to find a seat but notice only first 4 rows from exit had power points. Found a spare seat but 2 of 3 plugs didn't work. IFE was ok but touch screen very poor and as logical as an old BlackBerry system. Big criticism leaving Paris CDG around 22.00 they served a full meal around 00.45 - why? Small sandwich & drink would do 1hr after take off. But worse, the cabin lights on full till 01.50 then back on at 15.20. Given Ethiopian Airlines don't give you eye masks it was impossible to sleep on this overnighter. Left Addis Ababa 1hr late as boarding seemed to be staff talking amongst themselves, the Boeing 777 leg was uneventful and comfortable thanks to 3-3-3 configuration and IFE slightly easier than 787.

These factors resulted in extremely frustrated passengers. Although the in-flight entertainment, seats & food were average, I have to praise the cabin crew for their amazing service. Calls were answered quickly, food & drinks were served promptly & through the entire 12 hour flight ( & delay which was out of their control) they maintained a smile & a positive, warm attitude. I ended up missing my connection in Addis Ababa because of the delay. Ethiopian Airlines promptly put me on the next available flight, covered my visa into Ethiopia, booked me into a hotel, covered transport & food for me.

The plane used on the London to Addis Ababa leg was a new Airbus A350. I was very comfortable during that flight. The plane used on the Addis Ababa to Durban leg was an older Boeing 737-800. The service was still good and the seats didn't have individual televisions but that wasn't issue as I was still comfortable to read my book and sleep during the flight. The layover was a bit long (2 hours) as the airport in Addis Ababa is not very well designed compared to European standards in terms of the seating area, shops, restaurants, etc. I would suggest going to the toilet on the plane before disembarking rather than during the layover.

The plane's legroom is quiet spacious and we were able to book sits at the initial stage of paying for the itinerary. The food was okay and to be honest I think Ethiopian airlines is doing quiet well for themselves. What I didn't like is the stopover at Addis Ababa, the airport is too crowded, lack of space to sit while waiting and the restrooms were lacking. Can't compare it to JKIA. But overall, for that price, it was all good. The customer service was excellent. Can't complain.

Flight very early and very late on way back. So yes...the times aren't great...but that why you pay a lot less. So you decide is it worth paying an extra chunk just for a flight that has better times. Flight was actually a really quiet flight...they are new planes so they don't make a sound. Very quiet. Food bit blahhh....but I don't like any airline food. Good choice of entertainment. Kids were fine on flight.

Apr,2017.0,Addis Ababa airport is not fit for purpose!,London,Ndola International Economy,"We fly regularly to Zambia from London. British Airways cut the direct flight, so the shortest route is on Ethiopian. My number one complaint about Ethiopian is their hub airport, Addis Ababa. It is a disaster, very uncomfortable, very overcrowded at the times we are there, very expensive refreshment outlets that cheat on the foreign currency exchange, and depending on where you can find a place to sit, the place stinks of cigarette smoke from the smoking area. London failed to book our seats on the connecting flight, so we had to wait in a queue for 45 minutes to see a representative and book our seats on the Zambian flight. Four hours waiting in this hell hole is enough to put you off ever flying with them again. We have decided to put up with the rubbish airport as they are by far the cheapest. The modernisation works of the airport have been in exactly the same stage for at least two years, with seemingly no progress. The airline is popular, I suppose, on price terms, but the huge increase in routes has led to a corresponding increase in passenger numbers that the airport just cannot handle. One more thing - the food on board is of a very mediocre standard, and the service is very slow, as they don't have enough cabin staff. But its cheap!

The planes are in very good condition and with low level of noise. The welcome and the flight staff is always very friendly and effective. The check-in is however much poor and finding his departure gate in Addis is extremely challenging. Don't ever make any confidence to the electronic display panels concerning the gate and the destination. We got through Addis numerous times and the issues are always the same. In this last trip, the destination gate was wrongly indicated on the displays; around 20 people had to run from one gate to another; the boarding was chaotic and after half of the plane was full, everybody was requested to leave the plane because that was not the right one; the bus started to get from one plan to another, on the tarmac, trying to find the right one .

Apr,2017.0,"Good Flight and Flight Crew, Horrible Customer Service",Knoxville,Harare International Economy,"Let me start off my saying that my wife and I have been flying to and from both Zimbabwe and Uganda on Ethiopian at least once a year, sometimes twice a year, for the last 5 years. Overall, we've been happy with the service and price on each one of these trips. That being said, my experience with 'customer service' prior to our last flight was one of the most frustrating things I've experienced. We booked our flight from Knoxville, TN to Harare, Zimbabwe and it included a long layover in Washington DC (11 hours, overnight). Any layover that is longer than 8 hours has a hotel room included in the purchase price. This was the exact same flight and schedule as last year and we followed the same schedule as before. Just like in the past, I called the airline customer service line three weeks prior to the flight to get the details on our hotel room. The customer service representative I spoke with told me that they had our reservation but that it was too far out to have the details and that I should call back on the morning of the flight to get the details of where we would be staying and to have the voucher emailed to me. I ask her again if this was all we needed to do, explained to her that this was different than in the past, and was assured that this was how things worked now. On the morning of our flight, I called the same customer service line and was told that I needed to call two weeks prior to departure to reserve a hotel room. I explained what I had been told during my previous phone call and was told that that was not correct. Then I was hung up on. I called back and got a different customer service representative on the line and explained the situation again. They also told me that I needed to call two weeks prior to departure. I told them that I had been assured we had a reservation. They gave me a number for the local office. I called the local office three times and left three messages and never received a return phone call. I called the customer service line again, spoke with someone different and was given what I believe is the cell phone of the person who is supposed to be in charge of reservations locally. I called twice, left two messages and never received a return phone call. Over the next hour I called two more times, was hung up on once and was given the same local contact number again. By this time our plane was departing. We flew to Dulles and I began trying to contact customer service again. I tried each extension and automated option, trying to find someone who could help. I was hung up on three more times and told by four other people that I needed to call two weeks prior to departure. To make a long story short, we paid for our own hotel room. Not only has Ethiopian Airlines not reimbursed us for this expense but they haven't even offered an apology. I've always been happy with their flight crews. The food is okay, not great, but it's airline food so what do you really expect? The in-flight entertainment is free and usually good. My complaint isn't with the flight or the flight staff but with some of the poorest customer service I've ever experienced in my life.",4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Both the planes from Johannesburg to Addis and the one from Addis to Johannesburg appeared tired and scruffy. However the aircraft from Addis to Beirut and from Beirut to Addis was of superior class. The cabin crew appeared inadequately trained. Service was slow and erratic. But the real low point was the food. Stale bread roles, inedible meals and tinned fruit do not make for suitable food. A further drawback was that the volume of the announcements was almost inaudible. I did understand some of the difficulties of embarking large groups of people but I felt that some extra help was necessary for inexperienced travelers.

I am actually quite impressed because I flew my pet in the cargo hold on a 26-hour flight and I was worried that even though I told the staff that there was a live animal in the cargo hold, they'd still be careless (I was reading reviews on this site before I flew and there were a lot about them being careless). The most worrying part for me was my layover in Addis Ababa. My layover was 4 hours, so then I asked a staff if I could go see my pet to make sure she's fine and if she still has water and food. Fortunately, they said yes, but only for a short time. Was still able to refill everything. I went back to the waiting area to only find out that my flight has been delayed for 2 more hours, the staff gave us free food as compensation and then was finally called to board the plane. However, I think something came up because they led us to another waiting area, but my flight was quickly called after like 10 - 20 minutes. Staff told my flight to line up according to our zones and then another staff came and told all the passengers to go back to the waiting area when a man behind the line started screaming about their really poor service and how unorganized they are... I think that was like reality slap for them because they allowed us to board the plane after that. Overall, the staff were nice and actually cared enough for my pet, I had no lost luggages, thankfully.

Apr,2017.0,Great Jets but really odd/poor service and experience,London,Johannesburg International Economy,"This airline is bordering between poor/ok but they really let themselves down with their service/attitude. It is a shame really as they are very good value for money and with a few tweaks, they could be a really disruptive air provider offering an alternative to the bigger airlines. Their fleet is almost brand new and in really decent shape. I was pleasantly surprised and excited when I got onto the plane. I thought the 2 star rating and negative reviews I had read were all wrong/I had found a hidden gem. Alas this was not the case. Some key points that need improving: They sound out CONSTANT PA announcements - and it is all non informative. I don't want to buy things from your duty free shop at 3am in the morning. I distinctly got the feeling that the attendants felt that if they had to stay awake the whole flight, then so did we... This really was the most important point for me. If i am sleeping, do not shake me awake or flip up the lights and sound out a PA announcement. The reason the bigger airlines do well is they get all of that out of the way at the beginning of the flight and then leave you alone to rest or watch movies as you see fit. Food/Beverage - Service was slow (outbound flight non existent) and often non optional. I was woken multiple times by the flight attendant slamming down my in seat tray and putting whatever they had left on the trolley in front of me. This was not ok and if it takes you 3 to 4 hours to get the trolley out/down to me then I would rather you didn't bother. I wonder if this could be improved by being speedier (often it was only 1 attendant per isle where a lot of the bigger airlines have 2) or handing out Stickers that you can affix to your shirt or chair that tell the attendant if you want food/no food or to be woken up? Attendants - The difference between one of the bigger airlines and Ethiopia Airlines is they push customer service. They are often friendly and smile a lot. Yes I know this is a silly request, but I felt as if i was intruding when begging for water on the inbound flight. If i requested something they made sure i was aware how much of an effort I was asking of them. I must point out at this stage that I am not a picky traveller, i am a mostly grin and bear it sort. Overall, they offer value for money...but at a price of arriving at your destination having been awake for however long your destination is away (in my case i was in total transit for 21 hours) and will be hungry/thirsty. With some soft skill training and perhaps getting their staff to understand the difference between a ""tick box exercise"" such as ""oh we haven't done the sheba miles announcement in a while, lets do that one again"", and real customer service such as understanding that we are travelling and need decent rest with non intrusive service as well as refreshments promptly then they could be a wonderful airline.

Tim couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating and kind to us. He really looked after us and ensured that we would enjoy our holiday by getting the best availability.

Apr,2017.0,Horrible,Entebbe,Zanzibar Island Africa Economy,"Another horrible experience with Ethiopian airlines. All seems fine with Ethiopian until you encounter a problem Flight from Entebbe to Addis to Zanzibar delayed 5 hours due to 'technical problem' no information given by staff in Entebbe, missed connecting flight in Addis at 1030am and despite Ethiopian airlines telling my wife there was another flight in the afternoon, when I got to the transfer desk in Addis I was just given a ticket for a flight the next day and a voucher for Debre Damo hotel in Addis. No further information given. I knew Debre Damo was a crap hotel and no other possible upgrades were offered. So then I went to pick up my bag to go to Debre Damo hotel because I needed a change of clothes and toothbrush and I was told I had to wait an hour because my bag was in a sorting area. After waiting 45 minutes, I asked another staff and I was told, have a seat please wait an hour. Ethiopian airlines and airport staff do not do anything unless you push them. So I got angry and began to shout, and magically my bag appeared in under 5 minutes. This is also a complaint about Bole International airport. This airpory is the most disorganized airport in the world. Line ups at every turn and no one controlling these line ups so random people can jump in front of you. The departures waiting area is the worst. Uncomfortable seat and the line ups to enter the gates are horrible. They will just hold you in the line until your boarding time approaches then they will let you through. If you are not paying attention you may miss your flight. Once you enter the gates area, they will usually change your gate number at the last minute. Then they will usually put you down to gates 1-8 which you must take a bus out to your plane, despite there being many walkways open from the departures terminal. Once you are in any Ethiopian airplane the two biggest problems are if you push the call bell there is no chance any flight attendant will answer you and after you eat they usually take 3 hours to clear your dirty food tray.

After dinner we went to board the plane and we realized the flight was again delayed to 2.30. No announcement, no help, no apology, NOTHING! Not even water for people let in a half closed airport waiting for a broken plane. A decent airline would have given people a decent service and tried to replace the plane instead of having people waiting for hours and hours. Each 20 minutes they were telling us that the flight would have boarded in 10 minutes in order to avoid to have to put us in hotel (and pay for it). Useless to say that - even being part of Star Alliance - they refused to pay any compensation because the airline is not from Europe and it was not leaving from a European airport.

May,2017.0,"choose Ethiopian, you choose Africa",Dar es Salaam,Kuala Lumpur,"Dar es Salaam to Kuala Lumpur via Addis Ababa / Bangkok. I mostly fly with a bicycle (think of Pippi Longstocking). At Ethiopian Airlines you can't add special baggage online to your flight, even not attach a notice. But sports equipment is on their baggage scedule and a good fare for bicycles is given (100 USD for intercontinental flights). I went and booked from Tanzania (online), they have no call-center there, even Ethiopian is operating much from Dar es Salaam. An email to the airport office was not answered in 9 days. I called up to 8 telephone numbers before I reached somebody, who was kind, but don't understood what he should do with 'bicycle', while I wanted to go by aircraft. The clerk absolutely not knowed, how to book special baggege to a flight and what sports equipment should be. I should call the city office, where nobody answered the phone. The nearest callcenter in Addis Ababa not worked technically in Tanzania. So after 5 days with no success to get the bicycle on my flight, I visited the Ethiopian Dar es Salaam city office, where a very kind women tried to understand what I want, but after all not find any way to get the special baggage booked. After 1 day she wrote me a nice email, I should call the airport office, where another kind woman told me, she can't do anything, but I should simply bring the bicycle packed to check-in. They will take it in any case. At the check-in I was told, the packed bicycle is very welcome and will cost 250 USD. I referenced the website price of 100 USD, and the ground manager told me the bicycle are welcome, the cost is 200 USD, payable only cash. I was short in funds and so I had to organize Tanzanian Shilling from ATM. The only properly working international ATM at Julius-Nyerere-Airport was defect, so while check-in runs, I jumped with a taxi to the closest bank. The ground handling manager then took 500.000 Tanzanian Shilling, which are 223 USD (Mai 2017). The baggage (all within the limits) was proceeded and a view minutes later I got a receipt upon 200 USD received for excess baggage with many thanks. This is typical african and I found deals like that many times on my half year visit of north and east africa. The new old spirit. It is still less expensive as the excess baggage rates for bicycles at other carriers, but not the 100 $, which were wide spread for sports baggage intercontinental. On the other hand the flight was nice. I can't complain either the crew nor the aircrafts. The girls were nice and smiley and the jets clean, comfortable and fully functional, while in Africa on the ground nearly everything is dirty and disfunctional. For me, the crowd is also a part of flight quality. People, who complain the 'uneatable' meals on board never have been eating in Ethiopia. Compared with the food of simple people or what is served even in better restaurants, the onboard meals were luxury. They serve also Ethiopian beer which is very tasty. A bit disorganized Bole Airport (Addis). But in total it worked, many seats and loungers, fairly clean restrooms, shops with enough merchandise. No comparison to outside the airport.

May,2017.0,the shock came in Addis,Harare,Marrakech,"Harare to Marrakech via Madrid. The flight from Harare to Addis was great. The shock came in Addis when flight ET712 to Madrid was overbooked. Upon checking in at Gate 9 (changed from Gate 1), the Ethiopian Airline officers stood three of us aside, apparently because our visa to Spain and Morocco had to be verified by a senior airline officer. Myself, a man from the Democratic Republic of Congo and a lady from Equatorial Guinea. During the check-in process, the man from the Congo protested fiercely, and was let in. As the queue died, we (me and the lady from Malabo) went to the boarding desk to get the EA senior to verify our VISA's to facilitate. The Ethiopian Airline officer handling the boarding looked aside and shouted, Boarding closed we will re-route you. The senior officer had not pitched up. No one had spoken to us. Nothing. I couldn't believe it that an airline would cook false stories to manage its own problem of overbooking. Fastforward to 02:00 Addis Time, 3 hours after the initial boarding time, we were still in their office and the lady from Malabo promised to get into another flight on Tuesday May 16th. I refused calmly and with smiles of spite. They tried to get me into ET702 to go to Morocco through Rome and i refused, returning their initial transit VISA lie that if i could not do a 60 minute transit to Morocco through Madrid, then i still could not take option of going through Rome, albeit 48 hours later. Later, another officer assisted by getting me proceed to Morocco by EgyptAir. His reason for my transfer ""flight overbooked"". And at this time I asked to see the Supervisor. The supervisor did not come. As this batch of officer's prepared to go home at 03h00, my AirEgypt flight to Cairo was also boarding. I left Addis without seeing the supervisor or getting the truth. I will not fly Ethiopian Airlines on my way back home.",1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

May,2017.0,planes look worn,Nairobi,Lagos,"Nairobi to Lagos via Addis Ababa. For a frequent flyer like me, Ethiopian Airlines is a default choice for travelling across Africa because of its extensive network and, credit where due, on time performance. The good stops here as it is decades behind the service level that a global standard airline (or even Kenya Airways) would offer. Boarding in Nairobi, Addis and Lagos was disorganized, with no separate lines for Gold / Business Class. Despite being new, planes look worn with unresponsive touch screens, very limited movie selection and poor quality earphones. Food was utterly inedible and the service protocol is weird - Ethiopian dishes are available on flights originating from Addis but not explicitly offered to passengers by the crew. Addis Ababa is the worst airport in Africa: dirty, poorly lit and completely overcrowded. The same goes for Ethiopian Airlines lounges. Avoid Ethiopian if you have another choice in Africa.",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

The flight to Bangkok was great, nothing to complain.No smell inside, we liked the food, on board entertainment and the drinks! The flight attendants were kind and helpful. In Addis Abeba we thought the airport was very small, crowded, no space to seat down. The salesperson on Duty Free was a bit rude and the food there was expensive! The next flight to Bangkok was good as well. When we came back, the flight from Bangkok to São Paulo was not good! The flight attendants weren't kind and helpful, when you called them, they would just turn off the light and leave without asking what we wanted! There was a strong smell inside the airplane, but after the door was closed and the a/c turned on the smell was gone.

May,2017.0,Disorganized and needs better management,New Delhi,Gaborone International Economy,"While they managed to do damage control to a certain extent and i am thankful for the staff involved, i still felt that my story needs to be heard for better improvement of services and for everyone out there to know what to expect :- I was returning from India (New Delhi) to Gaborone Botswana and was one of the earliest passenger to have checked in as i was very early to the airport due to my local trip flight landing around 5.30pm. My flight out of New Delhi to Addis Ababa was scheduled around 11.10pm. After checking in and a bit of shopping in the most beautiful T3 Terminal at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi - i received my first shock from the ground employees of the airport near my gate (12) that the previous flight has still not taken off (to go to Thailand belonging to Jet Airways) so ours was delayed. Lie no.1 Then i was looking for Ethiopian Airways authorities and we found none, again some ground staff who had neutral dress code and no branding of ethiopian airways kept saying flight is coming and boarding is delayed. Now the time was 12.30 and they had only made one announcement of the delay after a lot of pressure from passengers. They were too comfortable to be quiet and too happy to stay away from facing customer questions while the Airport Authorities and Information desk were keen in assisting us and it was ""ONLY THROUGH THEM"" that i got most info. Now the important part here is ""THEIR SO CALLED SYSTEM"" kept saying the flight is on schedule, even after knowing the flight never arrived. Now that is another bug to be fixed. 12.30 became, 1.30... 2.30 then they said lets move to another gate which we did, 3.30... then another gate... flight is coming from Jaipur..... Addis Ababa.. from heaven and it was 6am in the morning and you must imagine the level of frustration so many sleepless passengers had to go through. Worst part was their communication and ability to handle crisis and talk to customers. We know eventualities can happen but they poorly handled it or did not time their communication well. We had to take it to shouting and conducting an almost protest with the managers to commit exactly when will flight come and how about our connection flight and losses arising out of it. They promised that the moment you land in Addis which finally was possible as their flight now arrived at 8am the next day that they will take care. We landed at Addis Ababa - one of the most poorly maintained, shoddy and badly managed airport where chaos and confusion is a normal state of affairs. Despite that the kind staff put us on a hotel - substandard yet heaven for someone who has not bathed for over 12 hours and not had a decent food. We were also given a re-route to JHB and then to Gaborone where i reached after a big delay. Ethiopian people were lovely and warm with foreigners and the culture in Addis was awesome. Had a great meal with traditional dance etc which was the only salvation from the bad experience. However, this airline and that airport needs a serious overhaul. They are popular for their cheap prices but am afraid you get what you pay and sometimes they go a few notches down. Food was okay in the plane i should say and bathrooms, seats were bad. Entire sector i flew did not have seat back entertainment as well.

We could not drive on to our first Game Park that day and had to pay for a night in a hotel. We lost the night at the Game Lodge, which could not be refunded, and 2 Game Drives.

The plane arrived, however, within a few minutes of the original scheduled arrival time. My luggage arrived throughout the trip in good condition. From my experience, this is a very good economy airline. The only fault lies with the food, which consisted of bread and almost inedible chicken on the international flights. The fellow next to me wanted a vegetarian option, and they didn't have one as he hadn't reserved a special order ahead of time.

That was extremely uncomfortable as I booked my seat at the window which I love as the views are great. But being squished in there was terrible. On the return I booked an exit seat away from the window and it was a worthwhile sacrifice for the extra leg room. I am a tall guy, but even the smaller ladies looked cramped on the 737. Second complaint is the Addis Ababa airport...I last travelled through here 5 years ago, and in all honestly nothing has changed. Bathrooms are shoddy, restaurants are EXTREMELY expensive!! $14 for water, orange juice and a croisant? And generally dirty and not a comfortable place to be. It really resonates the east africa experience that I have had at other airports in the area. Finally the crew on board all flights were COMPLETELY EXCELLENT!! Always a big smile and great service from them. They really are the pinnacle of your service and make the hugest difference in my overall experience.

May,2017.0,"Despite many negative reviews...Surprisingly good, even in economy!",Toronto,Windhoek International Economy,"Upon planning a current trip to Namibia I decided to use my Air Canada Aeroplan points. The only way to get from Toronto to Namibia with star alliance flights was to fly Ethiopian, not my first choice by any means. I have flown many times but always on ""well known"" airlines, but the points would cover the flights and the tax, normally $700. or $800., were only $114.! For that I decided to try it. Economy..... Check in in Toronto , easy and on time. Flight to Addis Ababa.... 787, very full. aisle seat was narrow, but I think they all are configured about the same. Drink cart the first hour followed by lunch (this was an 11am flight.) Pasta , roll ect. Not bad at all. Dinner was a meat dish with a little bit of spice and rice. Quite edible. The seat back entertainment was excellent with lots of current movies. Flight attendants very helpful and pleasant. Landed in Addis a little early, and yes, the airport is very busy and kind of jumbled up. But please understand they are redoing the airport and when it is done I am sure it will be world class. Changed planes via bus transfer to another terminal. Left right on time . Addis to Windhoek was on 737-8. I had been assigned aisle seat, last row. Do not get this seat. 33C has to be the seat with the least leg room imaginable. I mentioned the prior flight how pleasant the crew is. Well on this flight , a crew member in transit to another flight came back offered me her seat, exit row aisle, as she saw I was uncomfortable. It was not only a great seat but the 2 other seats were empty! The flight did not have seat back entertainment, but overhead screens. Not bad, but if you have a tablet, load some movies and music. Food was good and the flight was early getting into Windhoek. The return to Toronto was reverse of the above. Equipment, food and service were all good to above average. Got into Toronto almost an hour early. Ethiopian Air is a good comfortable airline. I have flown this route 5 or 6 time before on A/C, BA, SAA and Turkish. It's just about as good as all the others, and its less expensive.

So every time a toilet is flushed upstairs Gate 1 passengers are entertained by the sound of waste running the black polyethylene pipe. Never mind. And the mosquitos! In the terminal.

May,2017.0,Worst Airlines ever,Beirut,Gaborone International Economy,"My long & hectic day started around 12:30 midnight when for unforeseen reasons according to the Ethiopian Airlines our flight was delayed for four hours. Usually when I go with them most of the time the flight is delayed but probably for 30 minutes maximum. This time it was hell on earth and although my house is 5 minutes by car I can't get outside once am in. Anyways the annoying day in Ethiopia started around 11 in the morning when we arrived in Addis Ababa the capital and we had with us thankful the hotel vouchers and just to note all the people on the flight I didn't know and it was my first trip to Ethiopia and not voluntary or I would have done my research of the hotels. Ahead I will go on to details what happened to me and just to have an idea how unprofessional this airline which supposedly got one of the biggest fleets in Africa. So we arrived at the airport in Addis as mentioned around 11, when we came to take shuttles to go the hotel everyone except me were sent to a specific hotel called Debre Damo Hotel which I found later is fine, not fancy but you can manage by. The other hotel called Top Ten which doesn't represent its name it's a more top a thousand or a million hotel barely a star. Before the driver of Top Ten getting ready to drop me I asked him continuously anyone else coming to his reply was positive and my second question was how far the distance between the two hotels his reply was merely 2 or 3 KM which later I found out it's at least 8 to 10 KM. So reaching to the hotel obviously still no idea it looked OK from the lobby well average so I checked into the room around noon and to my shock still uncleaned, unprepared for new guest although knew ahead, they gave another room which was average. I went to the lobby to ask them for the location of the hotel the fellow Lebanese passengers are staying all of them at the reception confirmed what the driver said about the distance and even told me that the taxi they can arrange not from the hotel for a good price of $20 for supposedly 2 to 3 KM. I said what the heck since it's only 3 KM why not walk, so walked for 5 KM and nowhere the hotel I asked who knew said still another 5 KM so I stopped a taxi and to my surprise, the driver took around $6. I met the other passengers having lunch and Lebanese-Nigerian I met as well on the plane went together to the reception and tried to convince them of shifting me to a different hotel and called the airlines without any success until after couple of hours through persistence I got what I want but after some annoying arguments especially with the Ethiopian airlines' personnel. In conclusion, the Ethiopian airlines from my extensive experience with them are one of the worst if not the worst airlines you would ever choose. They disrespect customers, they don't care about feedback. Even one of the ladies in the airlines mentioned to me that I can go viral on social media they don't care. After some incidents that happened with a certain American airline it seems the respect from such organizations is getting worse as we go forward.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Seats in the Ethiopian B737 were of the old cradle type and did not incline very far. Still they were spacious and comfortable and, using the fold-out footrests, allowed for a nice nap. No IFE was available. Food and inflight staff on all four legs were simply excellent! Friendly proactive flight attendants served an excellent selection of Ethiopian and international dishes, accompanied by exceptionally high-quality wine. The two business class lounges in ADD couldn’t be have been more different.

Jun,2017.0,booked flight on another airline,Riyadh,Johannesburg,"Riyadh to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa. I booked a flight with Attar travels and paid cash for my ticket. On arrival at the airport in Riyadh I should in the line at the counter from 12 midnight waiting for check-in till 3.30am. No one showed up to check us in or explain anything to us. Because we continued to wait till after 3.30am (flight departure time), security asked us to move outside with our luggage. No one was explaining if there was a technical problem or flight cancellation or just a delay. No one from Ethiopian airlines was at the airport to assist with any queries. It turned out to be that this flight was delayed five times for the day. After numerous enquiries it was discovered that Ethiopian airlines was removing illegal immigrants from Saudi Arabia on flights that we had paid for. Eventually when they decided to check us in, they issued me with incorrect boarding passes and I ended up walking from one terminal to the next to try and correct this, until I missed my flight. I was told to wait for the next nights check-in at 12 and see the manager who would be able to assist me. So considering I already waited about 12 hours, I waited for the manager who refused to help anyone. There were a lot of people with similar problems. The manager told us to go to the Ethiopian office in Riyadh at 10am the next day to have new tickets reissued to us. So I was desperate and did so. On arrival I was greeted by more than 50 customers and only one officer to help us. Having already wasted two days at the airport, I decide this was enough and booked a flight on another airline and flew home to South Africa the next day. I have never experienced anything so horrifying in my entire life before. Not a soul can offer you an explaination or any reassurance, leave food or water or a place to rest and can you imagine having not slept in more than 24 hours. It was a disasterous occurrence that I wish never to experience again.

Jun,2017.0,was comfortable and pleasant,Singapore,Nairobi,"Singapore to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. At the airport, the queue was long and the wait was long.

The food was delicious and they gave amenities such as eye mask, toothbrush/paste and socks. The journey was comfortable and pleasant. However, at Nairobi my luggage was not there so we had to file a missing luggage report which took an hour. The counter staff informed that there are 3 remaining flights from Ethiopia to Nairobi and For the next few days, I have been checking online on whether the luggage was located but the status was 'Tracing continues' which was bad news. I only received my luggage 4 days later which was quite disruptive to my plans. Although this was an unfortunate event, I was overall quite pleased with the way the staff handled the situation. On my return flight, the flight from Nairobi to Addis Ababa was delayed for 2 hours. This caused many passengers who had connecting flights in Ethiopia to miss their flights. Passengers were told to go to various counters with no one at the counters. I was lucky enough to catch my flight. However, the information on the board directed me to go to Gate 13. At Gate 13, we were then informed that it was at Gate 4 and many of us had to run to the other end of the airport. One lady politely told the ground staff that there could be quite a number of people still queueing at Gate 13 and something needs to be done so that these people wouldn't miss their flights but she was brushed off with a nonchalant attitude.

The ground staff were extremely rude and would walk away while you were still talking to them. The food on the aircraft was disgusting, and I ended up not eating. The aircrafts are dirty and old with no inflight entertainment. This is the 3rd time in a row that they have lost my bags (I travel with them every 2 months) not by choice but my company books us on these flights. I received zero assistance regarding my bags, no phone calls or emails get answered and I'm told to go check every time an aircraft lands if my bags arrived. After a lengthy delay not even the crew could tell us why we were delayed (surely you should know as crew why you are taking off 4 hours late). Very unprofessional, very poor service and poor quality. Definitely do not recommend travelling with them unless you feel like sitting for lengthy periods waiting at airports not drinking even a glass of water, like people being rude to you, not eating your entire trip and feel like living off the bare minimum for a week because they loose you bag.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality
Jun,2017.0,left me with a bad taste,Paris,Johannesburg,"Paris to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. A chaotic check in experience for a packed flight at CDG. Boarding was supposed to be via zone, but when boarding time came at CDG it was every man for himself. Basically it was organized chaos. Passengers boarded with hand luggage that did not fit into the overhead compartments, and I ended up helping the cabin crew repack the compartments to fit everything in, as I am quite tall. The flight from CDG to ADD was the noisiest, smelliest flight I have ever been on, and 4 hours into the 6.5 hour journey, I wanted to use the toilet. The floor and toilet was covered in urine and toilet paper. I reported this to the cabin crew and nothing was done about it. The interior was the the most tired and dated I have been on, and my inflight entertainment was working on and off. Food service was abysmal, and after service the crew disappeared for the rest of the flight. The aircraft was quite dirty and one of the overhead bins opened in ADD when we were slammed into the ground upon landing. The leg from ADD to JNB was also in a 777-200LR, but on the upside it was quite empty. Meal service on this leg was a snack and a lunch and from all the meals this was passable. Service in general was OK, but nothing to rave about. In general the whole Ethiopian experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I would suggest that the airline focus on customer service, and do something to fix abysmal ADD airport before they consider expanding further.

Overall seat comfort is acceptable provided the flight is empty. The cabin wasn't very clean, and meal service was barely passable. The Cabin Crew made up for the dismal food and drink by being friendly. Boarding at ADD was chaotic to say the least. Aircraft was a 787, and was in a generally good condition.

I have to say that I am very happy with Ethiopian Airlines. The in-flight staff are friendly and courteous, the cabins well-maintained. But most importantly, the planes fly on time. Addis-Ababa airport is somewhat crowded but not quite as bad as most people make out to be. I think it is mostly the shock in comparison with swanky modern airports that catch people off-guard. But when you get over that the airport is actually function quite ok and the staff are by and large helpful. Particularly, if your stop-over is less that 3 hours, it is not a problem at all. For longer stop-overs the small size could make it a bit boring. For the Mumbai-Addis Ababa route the planes are either Boeing 777 or Boeing 737 when the number of passenger is less. The latter does not have personalized screen with every seat which is a negative. However, they play a movie on the common screen. On the Addis Ababa - Sau Paolo route the plane is Boeing 787 (Dreamliner). The food is sumptuous, but Ethipian could consider bring in some variety. On my way from Addis-Ababa to Sao Paolo the same meal was served on three occasions. Agreed that it is a relatively cheap airlines, but a little variety would not increase cost.

They use the Boeing Dream-liner aircraft, which even in economy add a little extra head and foot space that really makes a difference. There is a personal small TV in each seat that offered quite a variety of entertainment options. The flight was long haul, but throughout the trip there were two full meals of various choices along with a good spread of alcoholic drinks and other beverages. The staff were polite and very efficient, seemed a bit happier than many others I have seen. The one gripe we had on the flight was something kind of expected. One of the people with us had anaphylaxes (severe allergy) to peanuts, but luckily when booking it appeared they offered allergy specific meals. However on the flight it was clear the meal wasn't available for him, but the staff did manage to mangle a decent meal from other meal components. All of this came along with the fact that the price was very competitive considering distance, along with the fact that the 2 meals, drinks and entertainment came with the price (return flights for ~€750). I felt like they were more reliable than some of the larger and more well-known companies I have flown with.

Communication from that point was non existent: no explanation given in respect of the cancelled flight and no updates informing us of the alternative arrangements being made for our return journey. Eventually I was given a ticket for a flight to Johannesburg (only) but no further information regarding what was to happen when I reached Johannesburg. There was no one to meet the passengers who had been redirected and the Ethiopian Airlines was not open. When we enquired at a Star Alliance desk we were advised that the desk was unmanned and didn't open until the next flight was due which would be much later that evening. It took many hours to get a member of staff to open the desk and deal with group of stranded passengers (all travelling to different onward destinations, USA, London, Singapore, Vienna). I was advised by my tour company to claim compensation from Ethiopian Airlines, which I did. However the return flight did not originate in the EU and they are not an EU Airline and therefore rejected my claim.",3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

The price was very good and seats comfortable. The only problem was, we missed our connecting flight at Los Angeles. The flight from Dublin arrived at LAX a bit late and clearing US immigration and customs was a slow process. Also, getting from Tom Bradley Terminal (Ethiopian Airways Arrival) to Terminal 6 (Virgin America Departure) took some time. I suggest that at least 3 hours stop over is allowed in LAX. Virgin America was very helpful and put us on the next available flight at no charge. On the return trip we discovered that Ethiopian Airways departs from Terminal 6, different from Tom Bradley Terminal, where they arrive. Maybe more information about LAX Terminals could be on the tickets. It's all part of the holiday experience :-)",3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

The airport in Addis is very disorganized which functions like a flea market but then again we cannot blame the airline for that. fortunately we did not have to put up with much, since we were in the business class lounge which is actually quite nice too.

But otherwise it is a basic flight that gets you there. The flight to Dublin (final destination USA) was a more modern plane, with friendlier staff. Addis airport is interesting. Cleaner then another african airport experienced, but over crowded with very little direction given. i got the feeling that there was not much distinction between transfer passengers as the officials at security wanted to confiscate liquid bought at duty free at the previous airport Would I fly with them again?

I really can't complain apart from the fact that it is a 10 hour flight from Dublin to LA, and you can't blame that on the airline.

So huge legroom for us! The food was actually good, but since we were on a very long flight, did not appreciate that we were given the same dish thrice. The toilets stink after a few hours and didn't really improve even after they cleaned it during layovers. Worst experience was when during a layover in ADD, our flight was transferred to another gate then canceled after a few minutes (via monitor). Everybody was in panic, but no one was there to inform what was happening. We waited for around 30 mins before someone attended to us.

It was my first time with them and sure it wouldn't be the last. The flight from Dubai to Addis was on a B777 and unfortunately it was a total disaster when it came to staff service and the cleanliness inflight. The staff looked like they had very less experience when it came to handling inflight services. And the environment in Bole International Airport was even more alarming. There was no queuing etiquette and there was no proper advice from the airport staff towards connecting passengers. However, I was expecting an equally horrible experience on my return journey, but it all changed. On return we flew Ethiopians brand new Boeing 787 and their Airbus A350 and gosh, was it such a huge relief and such a wonderful experience all together. With talented and well skilled crew and top notch inflight entertainment system, the flights were a welcome feel to our journey back home to Dubai. The flights were clean and the journey was very comfortable.

Anytime we travelled with bigger brand names in the long-haul flights sector, we had issues with their check-in/security people and even after complaints never got any satisfaction from their management. But apart from a simple problem with regards to checking in our bags all the way to our final destination, Ethiopian Airlines could teach the bigger boys a thing or two. Their flight staff are great, the price is wonderful, their lounges are as good as any and their stop-over periods for connecting flights are correct....no rushing or sleeping on seats, just head to your next flight at your pace. The only other head-ache, which has nothing to do with the airline, is the security screening at Bole Airport(Addis Ababa). Any of you that have landed here will know what we mean.

Jun,2017.0,Flight Troubles,Beirut,Dar es Salaam International Economy,"Ethiopian Air is NOT recommended for business flights and I will NOT be using them for personal flights either, comments as follows: 1. Every flight in the itinerary had either a change or delay with two flights delayed by more than 2 hours. 2. ET 804 02JUL DAR ADD 1645 1925 this flight which I was originally booked on and which I changed at a charge of $90 did NOT actually exist. There was NO flight at 16:45 on 2 July from Dar Es Salaam. 3. ET 304 20JUN ADD NBO 1100 1310 This flight did not exist either. I was changed to a flight at 8.15 am but the check in clerk did not clearly explain that they had changed my flight, so I only realized upon checking the boarding card on landing at Addis at just after 7.00 am that I only had around an hour to transit. 4. The airport in Addis Ababa is chaotic. Although they advertise that it is possible to transit International flights with only 1 hour transit time, this is almost impossible without queue jumping the security checks, when you find the right one that is! 5. While sat in Addis airport virtually every flight that I heard being announced was delayed by at least 1 hour. 6. The Information boards might as well not be there. For example our flight was indicating “boarding” when we arrived but the gate was not even open. The door was still locked. It then advanced to “boarding completed”, then “Gate Closed”, then “Departed” before reverting to “delayed”. There was then another cycle of the same notifications before the flight disappeared off the board altogether with a subsequent flight to Entebbe appearing. During this time there were flights being boarded from the gate, such as a Cairo flight. Finally the Beirut flight did board from the gate marked “Entebbe”! It is much better to go with someone like Emirates or Qatar and know that you are going via an organized airport, even if the cost is slightly higher and the total (published)travel time is longer.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Jun,2017.0,Very Disappointing,Nairobi,Singapore International Economy,"I can only tell you about my disappointing experience using Ethiopian Airlines. I leave it to you, readers, to decide by yourselves to take Ethiopian Airlines or not. Original booking: - 27 June 2017 Nairobi to Addis Ababa - 28 June 2017 Addis Ababa to Singapore - 28 June 2017 Singapore to Jakarta Info on 3 June 2017: - 27 June 2017 Nairobi to Addis Ababa - 29 June 2017 Addis Ababa to Singapore - 30 June 2017 Singapore to Jakarta Note: delayed 2 DAYS! And we were forced to spend a night in Addis Ababa and another night in Singapore. Since this is a notification, there is no offer to accommodate us in either Addis Ababa or Singapore and they expected us to cover all the cost caused by the delay ourselves. At this point of notification, the safari, hotels and etc had been booked and all leave of work arrangement already made. Info on 4 June 2017 after complaint, Ethiopian Airlines provide us with other option: - 28 June 2017 Nairobi to Addis Ababa - 29 June 2017 Addis Ababa to Singapore - 29 June 2017 Singapore to Jakarta Note: must extend in Kenya 1 day! We agree on 5 June 2017 to extend and separately, we paid extra $180 per person for 1 day extension in Kenya to our tour provider. We consider this is cheaper, safer and more practical compared to arranging for Ethiopian visa and extra accommodation and transportation in 2 other countries. Please note that the only reason we extend is to accommodate Ethiopian Airlines delay. Info on 28 June 2017, when we arrived at the airport... - 28 June 2017 Nairobi to Addis Ababa is delayed from 19:15 to 22:15 then to 23:00-ish with no clear explanation what causing the delay - 29 June 2017 Addis Ababa to Singapore is delayed from boarding time 23:20 to 6:15. No meal is offered for this delay. I found out later on, that some of the passengers actually get breakfast voucher and access to the lounge because they insisted. The airlines purposefully let the other passenger go hungry and without wifi to notify their loved ones about the delay. - Obviously, We missed our flight to Jakarta and they cannot find any seat for us until, guess what, 30 June 2017 after all... $180 for extending our stay in Kenya now feels wasted and I still need to wait 11 hours in the airport until the flight home. I know a passenger who need to wait 2 days until her next flight. To be fair, there were no significant delay in our flights from Jakarta - Singapore - Addis Ababa - Nairobi. Their inflight service also fine. And after some pushing, they finally gives us a hotel room in Singapore. However, Ethiopian Airlines had wasted 2 DAYS of our lives just for waiting! In which days, our family and friends had expected us safely home and our office and work colleagues had expected us at work. I know a passenger who loss his 2 days holidays with family for Ied Mubarak because he already have another flight to catch. I should be at home by 28 June 2017 and resting, but instead I am home by 30 June 2017 dirty and tired with unhappy memory of my holiday in Africa. I'm sure there are more stories from my fellow passengers. Additionally, because of such confusion on our schedule, guess what... our baggage now gone missing.

It took the airline 3 hours to bring refreshments and they weren't enough for all passengers. Addis itself is unfortunately very filthy, very smelly and very disorganized airport as well. Food choices are poor, seating areas are little, the restroom are just beyond imagination and the security check is a major safety threat itself.

Jun,2017.0,"Reliable flying, erratic information",Stockholm,Kilimanjaro National Park International Economy,"As a regular customer the past ten years, I am quite aware of Ethiopian's advantages: reasonable prices, good connections, generous luggage allowance- My latest trip highlighted, instead, some of the disadvantages: scant information, erratic planning. Rushed by some hrs notice on takeoff moved to one hour earlier than planned, we were treated to a two hours delay, and an extra landing in Rome (not on itinerary). Having, predictably enough, missed our connection in Addis, an extra delay followed, until a new connection materialized, some four hrs later. All the while cut off the transit zone, with hardly any information, occasionally made to stampede back and forth between gates. In general, traveling with Ethiopian requires a dose of patience. But there are some other, more practical lessons: in Addis, the airline staff tend to direct late arrivals through a short-cut that leads directly to departure gates, bypassing security. This area is bare of any services or amenities (I think there's one toilet, at the end of the hall, but never checked). Two points are worth remembering: a) it is possible to jump this detention area and move to transit hall proper- look for a security check that is not jammed, and walk out through it against the flow (tried it also on earlier occasions). b) if you buy water for friends still lingering at boarding area, security may allow you to take some bottles across (if you ask them nicely).",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

It allows a generous luggage allowance (46kg + 7kg hand luggage) for personal and charity clothing - but do NOT overstep this. The aircraft are modern and clean with service, food and entertainment being adequate and acceptable in my view. Addis Ababa airport has been improved for stopovers between flights to other destinations with better toilet facilities and not necessarily having to undergo another security check in some instances. On the other hand the security check on my latest flight back to the UK was very efficient where something overlooked by the check at Heathrow was brought to light. At Addis Ababa one sees that the airline serves Africa very well with east to west connections that other airlines don't offer.

There is a great free baggage allowance, 2 in economy and 3 in business. Pre flight booking of seats free, option to hold flight before paying for it and of course they use a wonderful new fleet of dreamliners. Cabin crew are incredible. They are extremely pleasant and really take care of their passengers. I have travelled many times in either class of service and was treated exactly the same. Their aircraft have up to date entertainment system for each passenger and business seats lie flat. Really comfy. Economy is quite comfortable also. I am not a lover of airplane food, no matter the airline or the class, but their food is as good as any other airline I have travelled with if not better.

My flight departure was at 10:30 pm so I dropped my bags off at 12:40 pm, had to check out of hotel anyways and then spent the afternoon and evening scoping out parts of town I missed including two museums.

On one leg a rather bossy passenger encouraged her children to move over to seats at two emergency exits, where they clearly would not be able do the necessary if a crisis arose. Before other passengers could become anxious,the staff handled the situation very professionally and after some firm negotition, the children moved with a smile and other passengers came to realise that the bossy passenger in fact had a lot of resposibility, having to care for her direct family and some aged relatives, all in the same group.

We flew home out of Dar es Salaam to Addis, connecting again to Toronto (with a stop in Dublin to refuel). The long haul Toronto to Addis flight is overnight and 13 hours. It is a very modern aircraft with good food options and a touchscreen seatback entertainment system. No way really around the 13 hours, but the video options were many and helped the time go. We had a modern A350 from Addis to Kili with seatback entertainment systems. From Dar to Addis, an older 737 without seatback entertainment. The Addis to Toronto flight has a 1 hour stop in Dublin; you get refueled and a new crew. No new passengers. One problem was at Toronto on the way home, you have to wait for your checked luggage to clear and be ready for your next flight before proceeding to your gate (this is for U.S.-bound fliers). We waited 2.5 hours; it is the airlines responsibility to deliver the baggage and we found out our Ethiopian flight is always slow. A second issue is connecting in Addis. Try and minimize your layover time. There is ZERO options for any food or drink in the terminal past security. You will have to cross over to eat or drink and then go through a security screening again. Plus, the bathrooms were all horrible.",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,TripAdvisor
Jun,2017.0,Experience the African Rudeness,Dubai,Nairobi International Economy,"We had to opt for this airline at last minute on our vacation to Kenya. We were initially booked by Qatar Airways but could not use that airline since it was stopped going to Dubai. We did a mistake of booking with ET. We booked because after checking flight details aircrafts were mentioned as 787 and 777. After booking tickets and selecting our seats together, first problem came when there was a schedule change. We were supposed to have 2 hours stopover at Addis, new schedule changed it to just 30 minutes. I called the helpline two times to ask if this is sufficient time for transfer and the answer was more than sufficient! Because of this schedule change airline also changed aircraft to 737 and also ignored seat preferences. We got seats issue fixed but connection was a nightmare. It all started with inflight services, where attendant button doesn't seek at attention it's not a single case for whole aircraft. Cabin crew simply doesn't care. I had to go to all the way to back of aircraft where they warm up food, yet failing to get their attention and finally they gave a glass of water. Aircraft was having a strong unpleasant odour and the whole seats were soiled. I must say this worst 777 experience I had in my life. Flight was 35 minutes delayed for no obvious reason leading to a missed connection to Nairobi. From this point the worst traveling experience of life started. Transfer desk was highly rude and impolite giving blunt answers to all the customers that they cannot do much. After waiting more than an hour in a queue they booked for a flight which was supposed to leave after 8 hours. They gave us meal voucher but the lounge they were using for this purpose have the same adverse hospitality issues. There was a construction going on with no protection for passengers and the burning wood because of drilling in front of that holding place named as lounge. It triggers an allergy since we were not used to this and then we have to spend another two hour to search for pharmacy and there is no pharmacy. Finally a customer service rep got pity and called a nurse and that was the only lady who helped us getting anti allergy medicine. Now we are 4 hours in to our waiting time and another four are left and we don't know what's going to happen further.",3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

This obviously is dangerous both to those unruly passengers and to those around them. 3. We were only served drinks twice on the flight. I had expected more service.

Even paper cups and socks leaving no space for the passengers' luggage. It happened in both planes. And really, really dry crew.

We're talking 14hs flights, where you'll be on your socks. They didn't clean it until Tomé and afterwards it was disgustingly sticky. No magazines, no earphones in neither of the planes on the way back.

Jun,2017.0,Can Surpass Expectations,London,Kinshasa International Economy,"First thing to tell in a four-legged trip with Ethiopian airline: I did not have to use customer service to address any mishap. This made the whole difference between being appalled (see other, numerous reviews under 'terrible') and the present contents. The flag-carrying airline of a country with GDP/head among the lowest, did not raise my expectations very high. However, convenient pricing and routes provide good sales arguments to the airline, together with: good growth and new routes quickly opening, membership of Star Alliance, good profit rate (congratulations, but passengers failed to see the point for themselves). The delight of having to transit through Addis Ababa airport does not count as a successfull sales argument. To join the club of top global airlines, the company visibly thrives to learn the small things that make a difference, and to communicate that the company (member of the Star Alliance, yes, passengers will hear it often enough, at every cabin announcement) is learning fast. Online check-in, unless I missed how to do it, was not doable. The well-choreographed initial greeting, in some toga-like national dress worn by live sculptures, can deserve some gaping, as I did. The all-female cabin crew more or less did the job: the rubbish from the last flight was not cleaned up from the seat racks, a junior crew member was visibly not at ease on the job, smiles were sourced from some bad procedures book, etc., but we will tolerate these. The background music at the start and end of the flight (some jazz-ish instrumentals, maybe of local style) was slightly intrusive. The food was acceptable but unremarkable, with too light a breakfast. A special note, though, will go to the coffee, of outstanding taste. Landings (I survived 4 of them, all in good weather) were followed by panic-mode breakings, and lateral movements of the planes. Three of them were bouncy, one was a smooth touch-down looking like a caress to the tarmac. This inconsistent quality suggests room for improvement, unless it may reduce the fun? All in all, provided pax tolerate a few things and do not have to use customer service, I have to concur with the (heavy) communication of an airline on the move up.",3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Jul,2017.0,no vegan meals arranged,Amsterdam,Cape Town,"Amsterdam to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. We booked our tickets in January 2017 to fly 19th July 2017. The very next day, I emailed ethiopian airlines to enquire about our special meals and about seating. I had been struggling since day one and kept receiving errors online. Constant emails throghout the year until we eventully flew in July, they confirmed our meals and seating.. Our trip from Vienna to Addis, was awful. Our seating was out by one row which meant we did not get the arranged seating but was put in front of the toilets which flushed all night. The hostess struggled with english and when we told her we had requested special meals, she took out slips of paper out of her apron and checked our seating and said no, nothing had been arranged! We did have emergency exit seats from Addis to Cape Town but no vegan meals arranged? The air stewards / hostesses were not friendly or welcoming but short and abrupt. Lights stayed on until 2am after the hostesses walked around chatting to each other with duty free trolleys while people tried to sleep. We did not sleep a wink. I saw and hear other people around me complain that when they called a hostess, they did not come. One man kept buzzing for about 20 minutes and eventually she appeared. A woman had requested something to drink an hour or more ago and she explained that it was the third time she had asked and still nothing. We did however, have only one person who was extremely helpful ( Global Call Center Ethiopian Airlines, Bole International Airport) and communicated with me before our flights and after but this issue is now out of her hands and was sent to the customer service by me 8 days ago and no reply. This is the worse airline I have flown in 20 years of flying around the world.We are most disappointed with our trip and not sure if we will fly with Ethiopian airlines again.",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality
Jul,2017.0,stay 24 hours in Addis Ababa,Frankfurt,Nairobi,Frankfurt to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. First they forgot our Luggage on our way there and we were 4 days without our luggage. Then on our way back our flight was delayed and therefore we missed our connecting flight to Frankfurt. As a result we had to stay 24 hours in Addis Ababa in a hotel. But getting to the hotel was difficult because there was chaos everywhere and the ground stuff was more than unfriendly! They sent us from one counter to another and noone had any information on what we can do now! In the end we reached that hotel at 3am after spending 3 hours at the airport waiting for our shuttle. This was the most horrible flight I've ever had and the airline didn't handle it very well. I will never take this airline again and also won't recommend you to take it. Cabin staff and and the inflight entertainment were quite good. But sadly the food was horrible.,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,AirlineQuality
Jul,2017.0,lost the opportunity to sleep,Kigali,Los Angeles,"Flew Business Class on Ethiopian KGL-ADD, and ADD-DUB-LAX. Seat malfunctioned in DUB, and despite efforts by crew and myself it would not recline even using manual override control under cushion. As cabin was sold out, I lost the opportunity to sleep on a very long flight. I contacted customer service and requested some compensation, who forwarded my details to the central office. Then nothing for 2 weeks until I had to re-inquire. Finally they came back and offered me US$50 or 2,000 Sheba miles. When I said that this seemed insufficient to cover the loss of the seat for 10+hrs, then said I had ""utilized all the services of business class"", but ""to reclaim my confidence"" offered to increase their offer to 2,500 Sheba miles. Needless to say I will not be flying Ethiopian again, and I would urge others to think twice. As an additional warning to those who may be considering them, the transfer in ADD is absolutely horrendous, requiring additional security screening with insufficient staff, so plan on 90-120 minutes in line with hundreds of people pushing/jumping lines.",1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,AirlineQuality
Jul,2017.0,the best idea in East Africa,Lilongwe,Nairobi,"Lilongwe to Nairobi via Addis Ababa, they are currently the cheapest option to go. The flight was via Addis Abeba but still only half the price than a direct flight. Ethiopian usually uses a 737-800 for the LLW-ADD leg and stops in Blantyre, but on Saturdays and Sundays, it is replaced by a 767-300 and there are two seperate flights to Lilongwe and Blantyre. Check In in Lilongwe was messy, as the Check In Agents were the slowest in the world and the ticketing system failed due to a electronic problem. Ethiopian asks its passengers to arrive 3 hours prior to departure which is definetly a good call. As the online system does not know, that on Saturdays and Sundays the aircraft is changed, seats can not be preselected and so it was first come first sit. The flight was on time to depart and about 20 minutes early in Addis. Although the aircraft used was a pretty worn down 767, the seats turned out to be quite comfy and the legroom was enormous. Food was great (I preordered vegetarian) and the crew was very nice and welcoming. Bole International Airport in Addis Abeba is one of the worst managed airports I have ever been to, so as good as the flight was, as bad was the airport. The flight from Addis to Nairobi was on a new 737-800 and although it was packed full, boarding and takeoff were on time. Again very nice and friendly crew and good food. To put it in a nutshell: Flying with Ethiopian is usually the best idea in East Africa, their only downturn is their base at Bole Airport.",4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,AirlineQuality

In terms of drinks served, besides the juices and soft drinks, the only available drinks were one red and one white wine. No beer or any other alcoholic beverages were available.

The Boeing 787 from Addis Ababa to Paris was fairly new, with good lie flat seats and a clean cabin. The IFE was working, for once. Very nice cabin staff, very helpful and professional. On the negative side, Addis Ababa airport is still one of the worst in the world, with chaos and dirt everywhere. The lounges are only slightly better than in a US domestic airport and Ethiopian ground staff yell at passengers and rush them through the gates all the time. The inflight catering is stale and poorly presented, far from business class standards, despite a recent revamp of the menus and plating.

Service was very good, very attentive but the flights were empty at 50 to 60% in business. All four flights were on time.

Shocking!!! After the further investigation I have managed to find out that Ethiopian Airlines actually breached IATA rules and issued those tickets on Air Seychelles ticket stock. So about two months after they were issued, my tickets were simply just cancelled and airline ignored all my requests to compensate the expenses for already made travel arrangements. Facebook negatives comments were deleted straight away by the airline. I really don’t understand how they call themselves best airline!? They don't even know what the good customer service means.

My biggest suggestion would be to ensure that your layover is as short as possible as the airport terminal is chaotic, noisy and has limited options for food.

There is nothing inherently wrong with the flight and the airline other than, in my view, they choose the wrong plane (Boeing 737-800) to fly a rather long flight. It is small and dated (no individual entertainment option).

The ongoing construction had it set up to where you can't freely do all those without having to go through another security check! Ridiculous set up. Our flight from ADD to SFO was horrible. 1. Facilities were not maintained. The restrooms looked like a tornado went through them. 2. The flight attendants were not attentive. Multiple call bells throughout the plane were left ignored. It is unacceptable to pass by a person who needs something without at least addressing them. If you're busy, tell the person you're busy and that you will get back to them. People were standing up trying to flag a flight attendant down! 3. The screens for entertainment were VERY glitchy. Every 15 minutes or so, the audio and video would glitch. These things may be trivial but for a VERY long flight, this could be very bothersome. No attendant was able to address this on the flight. I would recommend this airline for anyone who is on a VERY tight budget and can endure a flight with the conditions mentioned above.

On arrival at Addis transfer passengers were directed into a room with portaloos, no access to food or drink, for a break of for me 6 hours. The flight to Lubumbashi was as expected pretty basic. My suitcases took 3 days to arrive in Lubumbashi. Returning we were not allowed to bring water on board, but I asked the stewardess to fill my empty bottle which I had managed to bring aboard. However on transfer we were allowed access to the cafes, etc at Addis! But on boarding my long haul flight I was NOT ALLOWED to sit in my booked seat which I had 'verified' in Lubumbashi, as they had put a wheelchair passenger in it who wanted to sit next to her son. So I had to stand in a corner for 20 minutes with the stewardess stroking my arm every now and then until everyone was seated, while they looked to see out there was an empty seat for me. I was really annoyed. This year I was forced to use the airline again. I took water and food bought at Heathrow, again we had no access to the cafes etc. My suitcases did turn up however, and I was allowed to sit in my booked and verified seat on the return flight.

So, I got to know their inflight entertainment system quite well - not great. The lights in the cabin are very bright - think surgical theater, not virgin america/atlantic mood lighting.

Frankly at the gate it was a free for all. Disorganized. No announcements, no instructions. Many people were confused on the boarding process. I did reach out to the airlines via Twitter, but they did not help either. The phone number I was given to call, was worthless. Once we boarded the 1st flight to Addis Ababa, it was full of unruly children, who literally kicked our seat for the entire flight. No parents. I did call the flight attendants several times, but they were unable to locate the parents nor stop the behaviour. Plane became very very dirty. Bathrooms ran out of toilet paper and towels. Ugh! The next flight to Cape Town was a bit better and less hectic. Food - terrible - same crappy chicken and rice with just a different sauce. The only positive thing I have to say is that on the return flight out of Cape Town we left late and had a very short connection in Addis Ababa where we had to run to the new gate and pass through security again. Well the security guard was calling for people for the Dublin/LAX flight so we were able to get to the front of the line and through security to catch the plane.

Jul,2017.0,Disappointing and extremely average experience,Johannesburg,Rome International Economy,"I’m not a fussy traveler (the bulk of my leisure travels consist of backpack and shoestring travel) and I'm aware of the fact that “affordable” often means “basic” and you get what you pay for. With this in mind, I booked a return trip on Ethiopian Airlines in March for travel in July: Johannesburg ORT to Rome FUM. The main selling point was an incredibly low airfare and a number of not-so-bad reviews of the airline. Being the eternal optimist, I reluctantly noted some really negative online reviews and decided not to dismiss an emerging, fast growing “local” (i.e. African – I’m South African) airline before experiencing it for myself. I’m going to summarize my flight experience before making a call on this carrier: - Two days after I made my booking in March (and 3 months before departure), I over-enthusiastically logged into my booking on the Ethiopian website only to notice that my return flight out of Rome was changed from the Tuesday 12 July to Sunday 10 July with a 23 hour layover in Addis Ababa, without my knowledge. By that time I had already made bookings in Rome and there was no way I could return earlier, but more disturbing was the fact that the changes were made without my consent, and without informing me. A very pricy international call and some hard words to an operator who could hardly speak English rectified the problem, but only after I was told that my original departure date was moved since the flight was “overbooked” (3 months prior to departure!?!). Anyways. - On the day of departure, check in in Johannesburg literally took 2 hours. Apparently there was a problem on their system, but there was no communication to passengers. Being a bit of an aviation geek I was really disappointed to find out that they had changed the aircraft for this sector from one of the new EA Airbus A350’s to a Boeing 777. Don’t laugh, but this was one of the reasons why I booked this flight – to experience the A350! - Once airborne and heading to Addis Ababa, the cabin crew literally disappeared for an hour and a half. Literally. Passengers called for water / drinks with no response. After about 90 minutes the in-flight service commenced; the food was reasonable but portions were small and, where other airlines almost force feed you and pest you with more food and drinks, refreshments and meals on Ethiopian were not at all enough (how can you run out of Coke halfway through the service on an international flight?). In-flight entertainment was good with a proper selection of movies, series and audio. - Then, Bole. Aijajaijajai. I had read some horror stories about Bole international Airport and, having transited through the likes of Lungi International Airport (Sierra Leone), Jomo Kenyatta (Kenia) and Kotoka International Airport in Ghana, I really thought these doomsayers were exaggerating; which they were, and weren’t. Bole is not horrendously terrible. But it’s dirty, chaotic and not at all sufficient for the volumes of passengers who transit through here. Passengers stand, sit and sleep everywhere and toilets are tangibly dirty in the poorly lit, half-dark terminal building. Passing through the security gates took about an hour and a large amount of passengers had already waited at the boarding gate in the lines of different zones when I got there. Boarding time came and went with not a single EA worker in sight. At some point, a few passengers joined us and told us that they were headed to Paris and we were standing at the boarding gates for the Paris flight, even though the notice board displayed our flight number and destination. Next thing, the display changed to the Paris flight number and destination and we had no idea where to go. At the end, all the Rome passengers had to walk from boarding gate to boarding gate looking for our flight. Again no communication. When we finally found the boarding gate to our flight, a very annoyed attendant informed us (we are talking hundreds of passengers) that we were late and the flight was about to close. A rushed and chaotic boarding procedure followed. - The flight from Addis to Rome was good and I was amazed at the comfort of the newish 787 Dreamliner which carried us to Italy. - The waiting game started again when I headed back to South Africa after my Italy trip. For some reason, staff at the Ethiopian check-in counters at Rome Fiumicino International airport only arrived at check-in 1 ½ hours before departure. By that time, rows of passengers were trailing across the entire terminal building with some really irritated customers and very unfriendly staff. Check-in was a tedious rush with no time to spare in duty-free as we had to take the hike directly for boarding after check-in. At the boarding gates, again a problem with the Ethiopian system and passenger boarding passes could not be verified – resulting in an excruciatingly slow process of manually checking each passenger against the plane seat plan on the computer. The flight departed an hour late. - After departure in a remarkably untidy 787, the cabin crew yet again disappeared for close to 2 hours. There were no ear-phones at my seat and about half an hour into the flight I pressed the call button to ask for a pair. Next to me was seated a hardly mobile lady with a sleeping baby and I did not want to trouble her by getting up to fetch earphones. Long story short – after calling the attendants for about 40 minutes (and about an hour and a half into the flight) I squeezed past the lady next to me to find the attendants in the back gallery chatting away while slowly preparing meal service. I asked for a pair of headphones and one attendant pointed to a used pair lying in the isle, saying “sure use that one”. I lost it and demanded a sealed pair. Food was served halfway into the 6 hour flight at about 2am, which is peculiar because most other operators would serve dinner as soon as possible on night flights to enable passengers to get some rest during the bulk of the flight. - On the return trip, Bole International airport was much of the same, and I spent my entire transit time of 2 and a half hours moving trough the security gates and boarding immediately thereafter. The flight back to Johannesburg was good but I arrived in Johannesburg hungry, tired and frustrated. And that’s it; some of the above may be nit-picking but that was my Ethiopian Airlines experience. Would I recommend this airline to my friends or family? Probably not. Would I in future fork out the additional USD150 to fly the (mostly Middle Eastern) competition where I know the level and quality of service? Probably... Thing is…you do not want to arrive at your (in my case holiday) destination tired, stressed and irritated and you do not want to return from your (in my case holiday) trip tired, stressed and irritated. And, even though we all know that cheap flight prices will probably buy you a more basic and less sophisticated flight experience, very few people would actually pay for an UNPLEASANT experience. Unfortunately, that is what a ticket on Ethiopian gets you…your flight turns out to be 24hours of waiting in queues, running around to find boarding gates and having to tolerate unfriendly and rude crew members. In my opinion, this can be attributed to two things: an incomprehensible ignorance towards client service, on and off the aircraft, and a truly problematic airline transit “hub”. EA will have to carefully strategize and, for the time being perhaps stop buying new aircraft, and rather tear the entire Bole down and start from scratch...and on this; quite a few online reviewers disqualify EA based on their experience of Bole airport and initially I thought this was unfair, since I felt you have to separate the carrier from any airport they service. Not so, unfortunately. If you’re gonna fly EA you’re gonna transit through Addis Ababa, and Bole is sure to ruin your experience of an otherwise OK airline. Apparently, EA has ambitions to become Africa’s largest operator with Addis their hub (much like Emirates and Dubai) but that is an almost laughable prospect if you walk through the dark crowded and dirty Bole terminal building. To finish off...if you are really cash strapped and you are willing to endure hours of waiting in queues, running around a nightmarish airport in search of boarding gates and someone to assist, and a mediocre flight experience EK is your bet. Otherwise, avoid and pay a bit more, even if it is just for the peace of mind...",3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Jul,2017.0,Broken DUB-LAX business class seat--$50 offered in compensation,Addis Ababa,Los Angeles International Business Class,"Flew in paid business class on a the return of my trip KGL-ADD and ADD-DUB-LAX. Seat broke in DUB, and would not recline, even in manual mode. Crew promised compensation, and contacted LAX ground staff that put me in touch with central customer service. Hear nothing for 2 weeks so had to go through the effort to find the right person. Finally, they offered me $50 or 2000 ShebaMiles. When I said that was low for enduring 10+ hours of a broken seat I had paid for, they said I had ""utilized fully the services of business class"", but to ""reclaim my confidence"" they would give me 2500 Sheba Miles. Aside from not caring about their customers, the transfer in ADD is horrendous. You need to go through security again and there are not enough lanes. it takes 60-120 minutes to get through, even in business class, as lines are not clear or enforced. At the same time, the departure boards are not updated, so even though every flight is delayed for an hour, the hundreds of people in line are panicking thinking they will miss their plane, resulting in line cutting, yelling, pushing, and shoving as people--a real mob scene.

Jul,2017.0,"Delays, delays.... delays everywhere!",Oslo,Addis Ababa International Economy,"Ethiopian recently opened a new route from Oslo to Addis Abeba via Arlanda (Stockholm). They use new 787 Dreamliner aircraft on this route. Despite previous experiences with ET, I decided to give it a try and just found out that nothing changed. If this is 'the new spirit of Africa', then I feel sorry for the continent... Check in in Oslo is decent. There's a queue for economy class and for business class and gold card holders. But that's where the fun stops. Fast track isn't yet available for premium passengers and also access to the Star Alliance lounge (SAS) gave trouble. So there's still a lot to improve here. My experience with departures with this carrier is that delays are the standard. To my surprise, we left on time in Oslo, just to get a one hour delay at the stopover in Arlanda for unknown reasons. That's an issue with this airline: there's almost no communication from the flight deck and the cabin crew isn't informed either. My onward flight wasn't better. Still a lot of delays for unknown reasons: I arrived 2 hours late. It's just like it used to be. It's frustrating. Food on board is ok-ish. It's not my cup of tea, but I can keep it in my stomach. I now quite a few airlines which have something better to serve on their long haul routes. The selection of drinks was decent, but nothing special. In-flight entertainment is ok-ish for long haul. Despite being a brand new 787, the system was very slow. When showing the flight map, my screen had several hiccups. This also resulted in several passengers (including the one in the seat behind me) to smash the screen as hard as they can in order to make it go faster. I couldn't explain to her that it doesn't work that way... The selection of entertainment is ok: a varied selection of entertainment, be it a bit limited in quantity. Bole Airport in Addis is still a slight nightmare for transit passengers. It's too small, too crowded. Fortunately, a new terminal part is being built now. I was directed to the departure area directly (as happens often), meaning that I couldn't visit the shops or the lounge anymore. There was no way for me to buy a bottle of water or anything during my stopover here. This needs improvement. All in all, it's great that there now is a direct flight with a line carrier to Africa (with onward connections), but the experience is so underwhelming and frustrating that I'm not considering flying them any time soon again.",3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Jul,2017.0,misstreated and recklessness,Jeddah,Sao Paulo International Economy,"we had awful experience with the airline and Airport. We were planing to take off from Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) to Montevideo(Uruguay), we have searched and tried several times to reserve online through the website direct to Montevideo. Unfortunately,is not showing in the listed destination. So, we have reserved till Sao Paulo then connect to Montevideo with 4 hours transit flight by Latam (Brazilian airline). We have taken off from Jeddah Airport to Addis Ababa without any issue. However, once boarding for Sao Paulo started in Addis Ababa, their team did not allow us to board due to separate ticket purchasing (They, said “final destination should by Montevideo not Sao Paulo ” they promised to support), we have showed them the check-in for flight from Sao Paulo to Montevideo but they did not listen to us at all, and they replayed “we will support you by reserving next day flight from Addis Ababa to Montevideo”. We have asked them to hold our luggage’s from leaving to Sao Paulo and they agreed. After waiting for 4 hours without feed back. The Agent asked us to adjust our ticket by ourselves or go back in next flight and adjust the reservation from Jeddah. we have agreed to go back to Jeddah with our Luggage’s and arrange the ticket with Ethiopian Airline Agent in jeddah. In Addis Ababa, We have checked with 3 airline officers for the luggage’s availability and they confirm that it is in Jeddah Cargo. Once, Flight landed in Jeddah our Luggage’s were not there. Next day Morning we have visited Ethiopian Airline Agent and explained everything to them, they could not book one ticket line as the Addis Agent suggested and they said it is impossible, They,confirmed that the only way to reserve the tickets is separated as we did. As monitor from this experience there is a lot of miscommunication and recklessness between the team and we were the main victims for that. Our total lost beside the time is more that 21,000 SR which is 5,700 us dollars for tickets and hotels reservation.

Jul,2017.0,"""Bus"" your way across Africa with Ethiopian Airlines",Cape Town Central,Zanzibar Island Africa Economy,"Awful trip in and out of South Africa in the Boeing 737. Tiny seats, no legroom, no personal entertainment AND a night flight. Felt more like a bus barrelling across the African sky than an airline. Food wise we were served the same meal in every flight - spicy chicken and rice - regardless of meal time, origin or destination. Still waiting for luggage 30 hours later as our original ticket showed us disembarking at Johannesburg and going on a South African Airways flight to Cape Town - all booked through Ethiopian. When we landed in Johannesburg, we were told to stay on the Ethiopian flight as it was now going to Cape Town, so our luggage, tagged for Johannesburg went to Johannesburg while we went to Cape Town. The only benefits in using this airline are the price, the fascinating airport at Addis Ababa - although the novelty was already wearing thin the second time we went through there - and if you are lucky enough to end up in an Airbus A350 at some point in your travels - which we did for our Addis - Zanzibar leg which by the way goes via Kilimanjaro.

There were three families on this connecting flight. At the gate for virgin -- (we missed the connection) the airline official stated that they should never had told us this -- there was no way we were going to make the connection and now our bags will be held in customs since we have abandoned our bags. It then took Ethiopian airlines 4 hours of us standing around to arrange another flight to SF. Never once was there any apology or any acknowledgement of our inconvenience at all. Eventually we did get a flight at 5:30pm when we had arrived at Washington at 8:30 am. Our bags did not make it and we had to file a form with United to find them.

Jul,2017.0,Avoid Transiting Through Addis During Peaks Until Completion of the Terminal Expansion,Lagos,Nairobi Africa Economy,"Ethiopian remain pleasant to fly mainly because they are generally on time, the aircraft are new and cabin crew terrific. The food needs an upgrade per previous reviews (e.g. grizzly beef, that horrible heartburn chicken sauce). However, transiting Addis at peak hours, especially night time, has become a traveler's nightmare, most notably, trying to clear the final security checks pre-walk to the designated boarding gates. There are simply not enough security screening points to handle the traffic. Even if you know this and allow at least an hour before your flight to reach your gate and get to your aircraft on time, chances are that fellow passengers that are not aware will be up to one hour late getting to the plane and your flight will inevitably. My 11.15 pm flight to Nairobi on July 1 became a 4.30 am flight in July 2! Seriously consider using other carriers until the Addis terminal extension opens in 2018.

Aug,2017.0,Would Never Fly Again,Kigali,Los Angeles International Economy,"Probably I could write a book about this ordeal, but I will just leave a review here for now. We checked in for our flight from Kigali to ADD to LAX. Got the boarding pass and then went to the Ethiopian Airlines office to check if we can buy an upgrade to business class. There, we were told that our flight was delayed by 2 hours and she got pissed that the lady at the counter was issuing boarding passes to people without letting anybody know about flight delay. After the 2 hour delay, there was still no sign of boarding. It was delayed for another hour. The hour passes by and they delay by another 40 mins before the flight eventually took off. By then, we know we can't make it to the connecting flight to LAX in ADD. It was atleast 15 of us in that flight who were doing the same route. In these kind of scenarios, in the past, you would expect the airline personnel to be waiting outside when you exit, to direct where we need to go and the new boarding passes. That was not the case in ADD, we had to figure out where we were supposed to go. We reached the interline desk, where we learnt that around 100 people had missed their connections to Madrid, Frankfurt, Los Angeles, New York , etc. It was total chaos. The airline personnel didn't know how to fix the issue, highly incompetent bunch of people! If it was emirates or british airways, they would be waiting with hotel reservations and new boarding passes. It took these people 4 hours to just issue hotel reservation and boarding pass. It was 4.30am now and we were exhausted. But fun didn't stop there. When we go to find the hotel shuttle, we find out they had also screwed up our hotel reservation. It took them another hour to change the hotel. The next day, we were put on ethiopian flight to DC and then United to LAX. Before boarding with confirmed with 4 different airline personnel to confirm if the bags are going with us. They all confirmed that was the case. To nobody's surprise, the bags were not in DC when we landed. This was the case with all the people who were re-routed on this flight due to missed connections. We also later learn from United that we were not on their passenger list and they can't find our reservation. We then yelled at ethiopian customer service on the phone for an hour before they fixed their errors and United issued the boarding pass. Oh, we were also told that we should be grateful for having given a seat in the ethiopian flight to DC!!! I would never fly them again, only because they employ all these incompetent people who don't know how to fix an issue and how to treat customers. I had to miss a work day because of them and it took another day to get our bags. So NEVER FLY ETHIOPIAN AGAIN.",3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Aug,2017.0,"A very good surprise: new planes, good food and plesant service",Brussels,Cape Town Central International Business Class,"With their new non-stop flights from Addis Abeba to Cape Town, which links up well in both directions with Ethiopian airlines' daily flight to Brussels (via Vienna), I was tempted because of the good travel times and more than anything that the business class deal I found was around half of Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and BA so I decided to give it a try. I was in for a pleasant surprise, especially on the way back from Cape Town because it was one of the newest 787s with better seats than in their first ones (a bigger screen, better room for feet of long people when lying down). I still think the chairs could provide more storage room for personal belongings like for instance in Air France. Food and drink was also very good and plentiful. Especially on the Addis- Cape Town run where they offered a selection of Ethiopian dishes. The entertainment system was also good, although their selection of recent films could have been a little more up to date. However, although Addis Abeba airport is small (and most likely you will fly in and out of terminal 2) it is an old terminal which is crowded, run down and not very well sign posted. I have seen worse in Africa, but just want to point out that while you may forget about the fact you're flying in an African airliner in these new Dreamliners, the airport will not let you in any doubt about the fact that you have landed in Africa. Still, people at the airport are friendly, the old business lounge offers both plenty of food and drink. Most connections are fairly short so it is not a major issue. I understand that construction is underway of a new terminal so hope should be on the horisont.",3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

They serve lots of food-some OK some not so OK like dried spaghetti with barely any sauce. On the way back, the plane was a bit newer and unfortunately for me the seat didn't go back, my light didn't work and my TV didn't work. This was an even longer flight since it went form Addis Ababa to Dublin to Washington.

It was 5 hours into the flight when crew came round with a meal, thankfully I had brought a few bits on with me as it was inedible and the smell. This was served with a warm soft drink poured out of a 2 litre bottle flat and not refreshing. Then the toilets I can't describe how bad these were not cleaned at all, no toilet paper just awful.

The trouble is, you have to change there for most onward connections to the rest of Africa! Transit passengers are shunted direct into the departures area, where there are no shops or cafés. These are all the other side of the incredibly stressful ""security"" . There are a very few temporary toilets in the departures area, located at the end. The so-called ""Gates 1-7"" are downstairs, escalator broken, no lift. The scene down there can only be described as pandemonium . Harassed staff members push their way through the heaving crowd calling out the flights, but there us nothing else to tell you where to go to board.

The safety procedures are vague! Yes there's a video from what I could observe people switched off. Take off and landing saw a multitude of seat backs lowered tray tables down and seat belts not fastened. Window blinds were down. When we boarded at Addis Ababa to leave Kilimanjaro two of the seat backs in front of me were lowered. At 1.00 am the lights are still on full power and I asked for them to be turned down and was told people were expecting duty free sales. At 1 am FFS! How are we supposed to sleep? No eye masks do I had to wrap a blanket round my head on the way out and wear my jacket hood over my face on the way back. This wasn't a one off - the 4 flights were all the same. It's just now what we are used to procedurally and comfort wise. Sloppy and uncomfortable.

Aug,2017.0,First time with Ethiopian,Cape Town Central,Tel Aviv International Economy,"A great thing about this airline is that they depart from Cape Town. I say this as most international flights out of SA depart from Jo'burg, meaning a 2 hour connecting flight for those of us living in Cape Town. So, before I even board their aircraft I'm already happy. Flight plan was Cape Town to Addis, change planes and Addis to Tel Aviv. We board their Dreamliner and found it to be clean and (obviously, being a Dreamliner) quite new. In flight entertainment was excellent and the flight wasn't full, leaving me with 3 seats to spread out on both there and back on the Cpt/Addis leg. Plus they are a Star Alliance member, meaning I can earn Miles. The only downside, or perhaps just an out of the ordinary experience, is that they took forever to serve the first round of drinks. I think I waited a little over an hour for the trolley to trundle past (this was true to all four legs flown). The cabin crew were also not terribly interactive, meaning they didn't go out of their way to make you feel welcome. I needed to take a tablet and requested water, which never arrived, as by the time the lady returned to my seat she did it with the drinks trolley, half an hour later. To summarise - clean modern aircraft, realistic pricing, food was as good as any other economy class airline, departed and arrived on time on the leg to Israel, departed late and arrived on time on the return leg; downside, the staff could be more interested in their passengers. Sort the customer experience element out and you will have a winner Ethiopian. I will certainly consider flying them again.",4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

On our return the flight from Entebbe was delayed 1 hour 40 mins and despite being told our connecting flight would wait for us we missed it by a few minutes. There was 14 of us who missed that flight and we thought that if the communication between Entebbe and Addis had been better they could have organised for us to be met and taken direct to our flight. But no special treatment - we just had to sit on the bus and wait for it to fill and then go through the queues for security etc. Very frustrating.

There was no office once we had gone through to even enquire about the kindle that had been misplaced two weeks earlier. The seats are cheap plastic and cold cement floors.

Believe me if there was a better was I would take it as I really dislike this airline. Anyone who has a good comment must be travelling business class which I don't. There is no lounge in Addis unless you are flying business or first class. The airport food and drink is very expensive. The flights do not often take off on time and the food is of average quality. If you fly from London they will weight your hand luggage at the gate and charge you for the weight including your shopping at the airport and jackets etc. BE AWARE even if you have the right weight of hand luggage if you have any airport shopping like magazines sweets or duty free you will have to pay twice as much again to take it with you. This is a real SCAM> There is a dodgy guy with dodgy scale waiting while you stand in line at the gate. The check in don't tell you at cheek in that if your hand luggage is on the button of weight allowance that you ill have to pay for your shopping again. They wanted to charge me 60 pounds for my jacket, pillow, magazine and sweets and no receipt was given that I could see. Then when I complained they said oh Ok then just 40 pounds and then oh Ok just 20!!!!! A total scam for staff funds. BE AWARE of this from London travellers.

The problem comes when you reach Bole International in Addis Abba. Far too many people for the size and capability of the airport. Granted they are building bigger facilities, but in the meantime it is not unusal to reach the airpor and find standing room only. And that can go on for you for 2 or 3 hours between flights.

Aug,2017.0,Good 5th Freedom flight,Stockholm,Oslo Europe Economy,"A very good experience throughout on this morning flight from Stockholm to Oslo. First of all, check-in was fast and efficient, and boarding started on time and was swift. Because the flight originated from Addis Ababa, we had to go through passport control before entering the gate area for our flight, but it wasn't really a hassle, especially as there were only a few people. Our aircraft was a Boeing 787-8 (registration ET-AOQ) with a 3-3-3 configuration in Economy class. The seats, which had nice colors, were comfortable with great legroom, though they were quite worn considering the aircraft was relatively young. Each seat had a power plug as well as a personal IFE-system which was activated despite the short flight, although the touch screen didn't function very well. This wasn't an issue on a 1h long flight, although I think it would be a problem on a long-haul flight. I was surprised to see how empty the flight was; many rows were either empty or had only one or two passengers, so there was lots of space. The inflight service consisted of only beverages (served from a tray), to which I chose fruit juice. It was fine for a 1h long flight, though a small snack would've been appreciated. Nevertheless, service was efficient, and the crew was friendly. We arrived some 15 minutes ahead of schedule; at 08:30 instead of the scheduled 08:45, which was appreciated. We had to go through passport control before entering the baggage claim area. Once again, it wasn't really a problem, and the bags arrived pretty fast. My only real complaint about Ethiopian Airlines, is that the cabin was really dirty, with garbage and used pillows, blankets and headphones everywhere. I totally understand the fact that the aircraft had arrived from a long-haul flight and only had a 1h long turnaround time. Still, a little cleanup would be nice in order to make the cabin look more appealing to the new passengers. I haven't flown with them on a long-haul flight, so I can't really say how they perform on these kinds of flights, but I would definitely recommend them on 5th freedom flights. Even if the flight was full, the 787 would still be significantly more comfortable than the 737s usually used on the Stockholm-Oslo routes (or vice versa).",3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

I first flew it to Lusaka in 2014 for a conference, then for a family vacation to Los Angeles in 2015 and now for a family vacation to Dubai. Even though we departed a few minutes late from Lagos we got to Addis Ababa on time to make the connecting flight to Dubai arriving Dubai at the scheduled time. Flight was smooth, service on board was good, but my daughters didn't like the food onboard but they have never been fans of airline food. The only issue we had on this flight was that our bags were sent on an earlier connecting flight from Addis Ababa to Dubai. AFter waiting at the designated flight carousel in Dubai without seeing any of our bags, we found them laying on the floor down the hall beside the carousel of the earlier flight.

Aug,2017.0,Ethiopian Airlines Africa to US,Kigali,San Francisco International Economy,"This was not as good an experience as the US -> Africa flight. To begin with, couldn't check in completely on line, and at the gate, we weren't able to get boarding passes for the final Virgin Dulles -> SFO leg, which caused us problems later. The good news - our bags were checked to SFO (and they made it). The Kigali - > Addis leg had a stopover added - a trip to Bujumbura, Burundi. Not noted in the schedule earlier or when buying the ticket. Nice to visit another country - but bad to lose our entire gap between connecting flights at Addis. Had to run from one end of terminal 2 to the other where our US flight was boarding. Fortunately ... fortunately things were running a little late there. Terminal 2 seemed to be in a different condition than a month earlier, but we breezed thru, maybe it's more tolerable for a long layover now. Flight to Dublin first - terrible, inedible food and rather unfriendly and forgetful crew. We had a refueling stop in Dublin with a crew change - thankfully. Better staff and improved food (not up to the inbound flight tho). Once in DC it took forever to get to the Virgin connecting flight (that's a Dulles issue) - and that, plus the lack of a boarding pass, was a problem. The third part of that problem was the tight schedule and lateness of the inbound flight - Virgin didn't want to let us on without bags, and they weren't sure until the last minute that they had gotten to the Virgin flight. We were the last passengers boarded on that flight and of course all middle seats as a result. It all worked out, which is fabulous. I like the airline but I will watch their itineraries and inter-flight scheduling more closely in the future when I take them again. I give them good marks for the overall experience inbound and outbound even though our return flight didn't meet that level.",4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

At Cape Town booking in, I was impressed. I did however worry about timekeeping. We boarded with little time to spare. But with 2 hrs between my connecting flight to Bangkok, I saw we would have a problem. There they immediately said there's a delay of 2 hrs. Free Wi-Fi to inform my pick up at BKK. but it's a rush going through security and the airport staff being frazzled by people becoming irritated at the disorganization of the airport and airport staff.

Aug,2017.0,Great Airline if you can Avoid the Addis Ababa Terminal...,Toronto,Kilimanjaro National Park International Economy,"Overall Ethiopian is a great airline. Their staff were friendly, the food service was plentiful and more frequent than most Canadian Airlines and the planes have more leg room than standard Canadian and American carriers. FOOD: - Your typical plane food. Good portion sizes that usually are pretty effective at filling you up but low on any taste or spice. - Beer and wine is included as part of the standard beverage choices (no extra cost) LEG ROOM: - About 4-5cm more forward leg room than other airlines would have as their standard even on normal economy seats. As an over 6 foot tall male this allowed me to actually sleep somewhat comfortably a relative first on a trans-atlantic economy flight. ADDIS ABABA: - This is the real downside to this airline, seems that most of their flights will route through this ""home hub"". If you think of every aspect that you despise in an airport this place is it distilled in its purest form... Chaotic, disorganized, loud, dirty, limited overpriced and terrible food options, no reliable wifi, disgusting bathrooms (usually with no toilet seats, toilet paper, or semblance of having been cleaned in the last 10 years), long security clearance lines. Worst of all there are these ""indoor smoking pods"" that dont work well at sucking up the smoke so one end half of the airport reeks of cigarettes. - My wife and I both agreed that beleaguered travellers here resembled refugee settlers, there is such a shortage of seating that people were all over the floors down the halls and the constant roar of people prevents any meaningful rest or respite on longer layovers. SUMMARY: - At its core a great airline - nice staff, good and plentiful food, alcohol included, lots of leg room BUT AVOID ADDIS ABABA hub if you can at all it is the worst airport I have ever set foot in by a magnitude of 10...

Aug,2017.0,Flight was not bad but airport was chaotic,Hong Kong,Addis Ababa International Economy,"The flight service actually was not bad, in terms of meals and a small care pack provided (toothbrush, tooth paste, long socks and eye masks). The flight attendants were also polite and friendly. The ground staff at counters in various cities were also helpful. We specially wanted to thank the staff at the Rwanda (Kigali) airport for their flexibility. We booked another set of business class tickets with Cathay Pacific and had to fly from Hong Kong to Wuhan in China, after our long African flight. But we only had about three hours in between the long haul, and the. next flight, even there was no delay. So at check in counter in Kigali (Rwanda), we asked it was possible to check in all the luggages, all the way, from Kigali (Rwanda), transit to Nairobi Kenya, to Hong Kong (destination of tickets with Ethiopian Airline), then finally to Wuhan China (our real destination). At first they were quite reluctant because these were two different sets of tickets purchased separately, and it involved so many stops. We were willing to take a chance and continued asking them because we knew we would not have enough time in Hk to go out of immigration to get the luggage, and check in again and then immigration to continue flying. They were very reluctant and confused. luckily we had a copy of our next flight and eventually they agreed to try! We made it just in time in Hk, relaxing in the business lounge, while all our luggages were dutifully transported all the way from Kigali, to Nairobi, to HK, and then finally to Wuhan, without any mistake. We were happy with the airline. It was the Addis Ababa airport that we did not like. It was one of the most chaotic, crowded, old airport we have seen. Perhaps it was such a hub that every hour there were thousands of travellers transitting. We had transitted in other African hubs and preferred Nairobi a lot better.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Aug,2017.0,No frills airline with sad catering,Addis Ababa,Bangkok International Economy,"Ethiopian has some of the best (newest, spacious) airplanes in Africa. I'll give them that. But they fall short on catering. In 20 years of flying (over 1.5 MM miles) never have I experienced such horrible food. The fish patty was had the firmness of a brick and taste of cardboard. All other items for ""dinner"" were pre-packaged (crackers and a breakfast bar). For dinner. Sadly, the return flight had the same pre-packaged garbage. Their e-mail response: ""We apologize... We hope this will not happen again in your future flights."" Obviously they've spent the money on aircraft and trimmed back on their vendor who supplies catering. This is unfortunate for an airline that otherwise has such great potential on the continental and globally. Ethiopian resembles a budget airline.

The boarding process was a little chaotic, but I feel that it was more due to the airports rather than the airline. Upon boarding, all passengers were provided with a small care package of socks, eyemask, and ear plugs, which were a godsend to get some sleep. The food served onboard was excellent, I was served 3 meals and 2 snacks during my flight from Toronto > Addis Ababa. The movie selection was great, and I managed to stay entertained for the entire 13 hour flight. The plane itself was starting to show minor wear and tear, but nothing too terrible. The lavatories were kept very clean by the flight attendants. I had a much better experience with Ethiopian Air versus with the domestic US/Canada airlines. I would definitely travel with them again.

We ordered vegan options i.e. pure vegetarian i.e. free from animal flesh, egg or dairy (milk, creamer, cheese, margarine, butter etc.). We flew Cape Town to Addis / Addis to Dublin return. Cape Town to Addis was fine. Every trip after that was problematic. My partner and I were sometimes given different options, and often these options included dairy of some kind. Sometimes there weren't even dairy-free coffee creamer options available. Staff need to be trained to properly understand various dietary requirements. I don't know how it compares to other on-board airline food, but these were quite boring.

KLM, Luthansa, Emirates and the old East African Airways in the 70s. Ethiopian Airlines current service and the A350 beats them all. Even LHR Terminal 2, of which I am not fond, was smooth this time with very helpful staff at bag drop. This overnight flight to Addis is at 9pm in UK summer and 8.00pm UK winter. We rolled back in an almost full plane at 9.30 pm. The dinner served about 11 pm was great, on the box it said chicken curry but it was a lovely chicken tika masala and other items on the tray were also excellent. They serve Habesha, one of several excellent Ethiopian lagers but unfortunately do not yet do Ethiopia's first class Rift Valley wines. Arrived Addis 06.30 and visas on arrival was also extremely efficient and quick despite a queue of around 30 people. I fly London to Addis return on average three times a year and right now would not consider any other airline for it.

On our trip this month, after buying the ticket in May, we were told 5 weeks before return flight that there had been some changes and that we had to call in. No phone number was given to call of course. I call USA number and was told the flight was cancelled and we had to return a day later. I confirmed the new reservations. I then had to re-buy new domestic connection tickets on my dime. While we were in Madagascar, with no phone we kept getting emails that our flight was cancelled and that we had to call. We could not connect a call even on Skype. We finally connected with Ethiopian on departure date and it turned out that they had not cancelled the original reservation so that they had duplicate reservations. This took over $100 of cell minutes to establish. When we checked in for return flight from Madagascar, Ethiopian could not print the boarding passes for the onward ticket from Addis Ababa to Washington DC. We were told not to worry and that we would be met at the plane and given our boarding passes. The plane departed Madagascar late after they refused to allow us to carry on bags (despite a check in 3.5 hours early amd half the plane been allowed to).

Sep,2017.0,6 days to find a bag and more failed promises than a politician!,London,Johannesburg International Economy,"Where do I begin on the chaotic and terrible experience that is Ethiopian Airlines? My partner and I flew from London to Johannesburg via Addis in September; we booked this ticket because it was £10 cheaper than Emirates and only had a 2 hour layover, rather than the 4 on Emirates. On the Flight to Addis, my partners screen didn’t work; we informed 2 separate stewards and were told they would sort it out before walking off, that was the end of it, so he had no screen for the entire flight. Luckily we had several movies downloaded, so we weren’t too worried about not having a screen, what we should have realised is this is how the airline deals with problems. When we landed in Johannesburg his bags didn’t arrive, the ticket counter was staffed with people who were uninterested and didn’t want to deal with ourselves and the 6 other people with missing bags. When we spoke to the staff, they didn’t have the correct forms and eventually printed one off that had notes on another passenger on it. We were told they will send out information to look where the bag is and that we could go to the ticket counter to receive $75 in compensation and a number and email to contact. The Ticket counter told us they wouldn’t offer the compensation there, and we would have to collect the money at Cape Town (our point of departure) 3 weeks later. The phone number didn’t work, so a quick google search lead us to another number. Whilst calling these numbers we were moved from pillar to post and in the end given 5 different numbers to call, each new number was fruitless. We eventually got a response from the airline over email and were told that the bag had been sent to Nigeria, but they had sent out communication to receive it. We asked the email contact for a daily update, as my partner was living out of hand luggage and the limited clothing we had to buy each day. We received no more information, and had to email and try call every day, despite our pleas that all we wanted was to be kept informed. After 4 days in Johannesburg we were driving to Durban, in a desperate attempt to try gain information we went onto their social media accounts to try receive an adequate response, again this was lead us nowhere. Eventually we were told that the bag would be delivered to our hotel on Thursday. Thursday came and went and no bag was in sight. Desperate on Friday morning, as we had a wedding to attend on Saturday and no clothes for it, we found the CEO and board of directors and cc’d them in the email, we got a call within 10 minutes. The bag arrived later that morning, 6 days later. Luckily we had a 3 week vacation, but many people who travel for a week would have had nothing. Unfortunately we had spent just over the R1000 compensation we were told we would receive and had to post the gifts we had brought for friends in Johannesburg, and asked for these expenses to be reimbursed, as we would not have needed to post anything if the bag had not taken 6 days to reach us. No answers. Desperate for clarity we again took to social media and emails for a response and nothing! We asked for the compensation and for business upgrades. We were told the morning of our flight that we would receive a business upgrade on the first leg of our flight, Cape Town to Addis. When we arrived at the airport, we were told that only the R1000 will be given to us and only my partner was authorised for the upgrade. After showing the email response confirming that both of us had the upgrade we were told that they were unable to do this as their managers had only authorised this. We phoned management and were told the same thing. When we mentioned to the manager that his email, sent 3 hours earlier, had confirmed for the both of us, we were told it is not company policy. Obviously losing a bag for 6 days is fine within policy. We accepted that clearly, damage control is not a priority for this airline, and they will strive to do the bare minimum for customers. When boarding the plane, the ground staff we had dealt with told us that we both had the upgrade, we entered the plane. The Air stewards said no and only my partner went to business class. Again we were told something and in reality this did not happen. This seems to be the theme with this airline, they confirm something with you and then that fails to materialise. As an airline, in terms of entertainment, space and food, it is all average, with nothing spectacular standing out. Addis is having major refurbishments reflects the nostalgia of air travel in the 70’s, without actually having been improved since then. When deciding to book tickets, go with another airline. Whilst some tickets may have longer kay overs or be a little more expensive, other airlines make sure that their consumers are looked after and try to minimise the negative effects of having a lost bag. Ethiopian was determined to not make any effort at all with regards to helping us and certainly promised several things but failing to follow through with it. Save your cash a little more and actually treat yourself to a company that knows a thing or two about good customer service.",2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Sep,2017.0,Disappointed,Cape Town Central,Frankfurt International Economy,"My boyfriend lives in Cape Town, I'm from Frankfurt. I fly back and forward for 4 years now and tried quite a few stops and airlines. It was the first time we booked Ethiopian airlines. I read a lot of very bad reviews, so I was worried. My flight from Frankfurt to Cape Town (2,5h stop in Addis Adeba) was much better than expected. Seats were bigger and comfy, staff friendly and luggage arrived fast. Food was horrible tho. Anyways, I was positively surprised. On my way back now on the other hand: my boyfriend got a text message on his phone saying the flight from Cape Town to addis will be delayed 1,5h. My emails still showed all normal. So we called the airport and they told us the flight will be delayed but I still have to check in the normal time! So we rushed to the airport and I told them that I won't make my connection flight to Frankfurt then (which would have been 1h after arrival). They said I should go through to the gate for more updates. So off I go. After waiting for ages at the gate (the plane was even more delayed) one lady said people to Frankfurt will have to sleep in a hotel in Ethiopia provided by them and only catch a connection flight 24h later!!! My bag will go to Frankfurt without me. So now I'm flying to addis (it's now already 23:45 and dark). I then had to find the transfer desk who gave me a 24h visa and provided me with the new flight ticket for tomorrow. As I try to find my ""free"" provided shuttle at the airport, a lady calls all people with given hotels to a desk so that she can change the hotels (as the given ones were now fully booked!). With a hand written Hotel I now try find the shuttle outside in the dark as a female by myself to then finally get a lift to the ""hotel"". Beacon hotel, no hotel but more of a B&B provided by the airline, in a horrible surrounding far from the airport, with no luggage or phone charger, 2 English tv channels, confused staff, and forced to sit it out till tonight (in 22h) till some shuttle finally brings me back to the airport. No other passengers or travelers to Frankfurt at my hotel. I would need a pharmacy but am worried to leave this ""hotel"". I was supposed to be at work today. I thought I would be able to write a good review about this airline, but here I am now, same thing happened to me and I'm very disappointed. Emirates would have at least given passengers free flight vouchers for next time and a adequate accommodation. Never will I fly this airline again, just my personal choice. IF you have to, make sure you don't travel alone, have an emergency overnight stay bag with you (sleeping clothes, toothbrush, phone charger, food), and be flexibel about arrival times (it may vary in more than one day). I assume this airline won't make it much longer, if they are unable to make their times and make use of their costumers like this. This must all be a big joke!!!",3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

While the outward flight, joining the flight from LA at Dublin, was almost lie flat the configuration on the return leg, Cape Town to Addis Abba, was true lie flat with a new configuration of the seating in business class and extremely comfortable. Food, drink and service were excellent. The only drawback to the experience was the confiscation of an item, purchased in south africa by the customs at Addis Abba, following a 3 day stop over.. As the VAT had been refunded on the time in South Africa the receipt was retained by the authorities in South Africa. The customs decided that the lack of receipt was sufficient reason to confiscate the item, a small bowl.

Check in is normally smooth being a gold member of Star Alliance means I get to skip the long queue and at times with my luggage being slightly overweight (3 x 23kg), still gets allowed with no hassle.

The staff on the flights were great the service was really good, they are friendly and s helpful. They also specialize in tarmac transfers so I didn't go into the airport on my first connection in Ethiopia. Yes all my flights left late but we still go to our destinations on time. You always have to keep in mind that this is a low cost airline and you cannot expect the same level of service you will get from someone like Emirates or Qatar. But I have to honestly tell you I received better treatment from the staff on Ethiopian Airlines than Emirates. I did not have my own in flight entertainment on the smaller aircrafts but they still played movies and series on the drop down screens and it was fine. If I have one complaint it is the staff at the airport, they are unprofessional and do not always look like they know what is going on. They have an attitude that they are important and you just have to wait. I missed a connecting flight due to the fact the we landed late but that was because the weather was bad and we had to wait for it to clear. The staff gave me the option of a direct flight to Kuwait but that would only be in 24 hours time and I would have to stay in a hotel provided by them or they can send me to Saudi and I will have a connection there to Kuwait. I decided to take that option as that would get me home quicker.

Oct,2017.0,just an okay airline,Los Angeles,Entebbe International Economy,"Ethiopian Airlines is fine. The seats are decently comfortable. The entertainment system was terrible! It had to be rebooted several times during our flight because it stopped working. Then on my last leg home (Dublin to LA), my screen didn't work at all! It was so disappointing. The food was fine, but they didn't give much. Even on the long leg, they only gave one hot meal. The rest was snacks. I generally expect 2 hot meals (dinner and breakfast) on a 10+ hour flight. I also did NOT enjoy the stop in Dublin. It's pretty brutal to not be allowed off the plane after an 11 hour flight, with 8 more hours to Addis Ababa. It was annoying, too, because while the cleaning crew was asking us to stand up so they could clean around us, the flight attendants were yelling at us to sit down and stay in our seats. It's not a very good system (and watching them ""clean"" the plane did not give me much faith). The check-in at LAX was an absolute disaster. Their computer crashed so many times that they ended up HANDWRITING luggage tags. I was very surprised that my baggage actually made it all the way to Uganda with me! They did allow me a 17 hour layover in Addis, which I loved! I got to go out and explore the city. Addis Ababa Airport is probably the worst airport I've ever been in, so try to minimize your layover time there! I've honestly been in bus stations that were cleaner and had more amenities.

On the second leg, we were in the middle set of three seats (there were two of us traveling together) instead of in one of the outside rows with two seats. That was very frustrating especially after the gate agent in Toronto said he would get this fixed for our second leg. The aircraft were very nice (a 787-800 and a 777) and comfortable. The entertainment offerings were varied. The service on-board was excellent! The food was interesting and tasty. The business class cabin was only half full so anytime I needed anything, a flight attendant was immediately on it.

However, if a function of the quality of flight is gauged by the personnel (especially air crew), then I have no complaints. The service is smart and professional, and the meals, etc. of an acceptable standard. The airport at Addis needs a makeover, and unfortunately the level of service and maintenance there is lacking against international standards.

Eventually, after several weeks of emails, they agreed for a 75$ compensation, which is ridiculously low.

The entertainment system is probably from the early 90s. Also, one gentleman was complaining on the plane that due to overbooking he was not able to fly the day before.

Oct,2017.0,New planes and great for pan-Africa but service needs some work,London,Addis Ababa International Business Class,"There are a lot of things to like about this airline, especially for pan-African travel, and starts with their new 787 and a350 planes and direct flights, but some things still need work- mainly their service and efficiency. Depending on departure one can never be sure whether a business class security or immigration line will be open and manned or not, and then on an econ class flight from Rome it took over an hour and 10 mins to check in a bag as they only had 2 desks operating of 6. I find their new business class seats not as comfortable as others like Emirates or Etihad or even BA or United. They angle in when flat and it crams your feet into a tiny space. And i just don't find their cushioning comfortable. The amenity kit is standard. The infight ent system is often in repair (have been on 3 flights where once it didn't work at all, and twice the planes were delayed due to operational problems with the system itself) and yet the system lacks a decent quantity of fresh new programming compared to its competitors. After 6 flights in 2 months there's nothing to watch, nor does their inflight magazine seem to change that often. But it's the service on board that drives me crazy. Haphazard service of welcoming drinks (why they insist on having one person hold the tray while another pours champagne, and then spills into a glass of juice to make a mimosa), of magazines, of hot towels- it's just not consistent. And then given that all of the flights I have been on unfortunately are red eyes they have the most inefficient meal service I have seen recently. Some 1.5 hours into the flights, in the middle of the night departure time, they'll serve a meal slowly (and I can't say the meals I've had have been great at all, neither biz or econ- but apparently it's because now they do their own catering that it's gone downhill) and then things don't get picked up quickly- last flight all was picked up 2.5 hours into the 7 hour flight- and then they started up again with a breakfast service 2.15 hours from landing. You just can't get any sleep- they flip the lights on and off- and beyond that their carts and trays are just noisy. That's if the staff isn't having a group chat as well upfront for all to hear. While the staff are generally lovely, they're just not on top of things and it's frustrated me multiple times. Boarding can often be a scrum and the notion of business boarding first gets lost. The best flights I've had are the 1 hour internal flights in Ethiopia rather than the long distance ones. But overall, on red eye flights, please figure out how to serve quickly and efficiently so as not to disturb those trying to sleep, and breakfast for those who want ti should be quick and quiet. One flight i got a form asking my preference of a full meal up to 2 hours out, a limited meal up to 1.5 hours out or coffee service up to 1 hour out but all other flights no form or even request.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Oct,2017.0,Overseas Staff Negligent and/or Misinformed,Lagos,Bangkok International Economy,"First let me say that the Ethiopian staff aboard Ethiopian Airlines are wonderful. Friendly, helpful and polite. The airline itself is decent. However, the local Ethiopian Airlines staff in both Lagos and Bangkok leave much to be desired. I flew with my dog in cabin in October 2016. I got permission in advance from the airline. Note that the website clearly states pet-in-cabin is allowed. I was quoted a couple of different prices that ranged from $10 to $14 dollars per kilogram. In my case, a total of $60 maximum, only to be told that it would be $230 each way! Outrageous. We resolved this, since I had these quotes in writing. New pet polices/charges went into effect September 2017. I contacted the airline in August 2017 to be sure of what the new pricing would be and to ensure that my dog could fly in cabin (as per the website). Long story short, the Lagos staff only booked my dog in cabin one way, which I didn't discover until it was time to leave Bangkok. Sheer negligence on the part of the Lagos staff. Incredulous. I viewed the booking on the screen with the Thai staff at the airport. PETC only booked Lagos to Bangkok. Nonetheless, it stands to reason that this was an error and I did not intend to leave my dog behind. The Thai Ethiopian staff were adamant that pet-in-cabin is not allowed on Ethiopian Airlines. This is in spite of email correspondence, my prior flights with pet-in-cabin, and their website, which states: 1.Pets (cats and dogs) as defined in current passenger tariffs, when in a container and accompanied by a passenger or shipped as Cargo, may be carried in cabin or baggage compartment. 2. Ethiopian accepts Dog or Cat into the cabin with limited number per compartment(2 in Economy class and 1 in business class)with a box measuring dimensions not more than 55X40X20cms and does not exceed 8kgs including transport container. 3. Dog or Cat contained in boxes larger than 55X40X20cms dimension, shall not be accepted in cabin and therefore shall be loaded in belly. Permission to get on the plane with my dog (4kg in carrier) rested with the pilot, if you can imagine. Thankfully, he said yes. All my documents were in order, and I had just been at the airport the previous day to secure the airport health check and export papers. Furthermore, I was told by the Thai Ethiopian staff that a pet-in-cabin can't be a window seat, so I got moved to an aisle seat. 10 years of traveling with pet-in-cabin and I have always had a window seat. It has never been an issue. Ludicrous! I felt like I was being bullied. On top of this, my requested vegetarian meals (Lagos Ethiopian staff) were not requested, though the staff on board accommodated me. Again, the flight attendants were wonderful. Ethiopian Airlines may be fine if you don't have any special requests. I definitely would not choose them if you plan to fly with your pet-in-cabin, or in cargo for that matter.",3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Rest of the group was speeded all over the plain ... When trying to ask for the help of the Ethiopian Airlines customer service representative she said that “it’s not her problem”, and wouldn’t help us - it's the system she said and she can do nothing ! Also in the check in desk they wouldn't help us fixing the problem caused by their system ... we are deeply disappointed from the LACK of service, support or consideration we received from Ethiopian Airlines!!!

The planes were great, (economy) food was okay, in-flight crew and service was good. Even the layover process was okay - we were called up by the gate crew and furnished with the hotel voucher. And transiting in and out of Addis Ababa Bole International was fairly smooth - ie. no visa hassle: showed immigration the hotel voucher and we were good to go. Plus, our check-in bags were tagged correctly and made it to our destination, so all good. The layover hotel was another story. The Afarensis International Hotel tainted what would have otherwise been a pleasant trip using Ethiopian Airlines. The location certainly questionable at best. And the room, particularly the carpet, was not clean. The hotel was extremely slow serving the included dinner and refreshments to numerous guests.

The food was inedible. But the real problem came when we missed our connecting flight and were forced to stay overnight in Addis Ababa. We were not given an explanation. I accept that sometimes these things happen. The airline put us up in a hotel which was situated in the slums of Addis Ababa. The wifi didn't work, neither did the phones and the electricity was intermittent. The rooms were old, tatty and not the most pleasant of smells. We were unable to retrieve our luggage as a result of the fact that Addis Ababa is probably the WORST airport in the world. And I have passed through many airports over the years. And of course there were no representatives of the airline around to help us. I would expect an airline which respects itself, to respect its clients enough to put them up in a decent hotel. Apart from the fact that my trip to SA was shortened by a day, the experience was truly appalling.

Flight delayed by 5 hours, only notified when checking in at the airport. The incompetent fools could not even work out that if a plane departs 5 Hrs late its going to lave 5 hrs late. NO attempt to accommodate passengers in flight lounge, No attempt to assist passengers who WILL miss connecting flights. In other words if you fly this airline DO NOT expect anything other than a seat on a flight as and when they decide to fly you. any delay is your problem and DO NOT expect ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES to keep you informed or give you any ASSISTANCE of any kind. However their (professional liars) staff, who certainly HAVE NOT read any of the rubbish Ethiopian Airlines publish as their commitment to customer care, will tell you any lie in order that passengers leave them alone. 3 hours in Tel Aviv and another 3.5 Hours in Addis just to get the incompetent staff to reschedule 1 flight and confirm it. Due to the ridiculous amount of time couldn't get to hotel because Ethiopian Airlines couldn't even organize the transport to and from hotel. Bluntly refused to allow passengers access to any of the Travel Lounges, as for meal and refreshment vouchers, kindly check your inbox, certainly has not arrived in mine.

Nov,2017.0,"Modern Planes, Customer Service Needs Improvement",Washington DC,Victoria International Economy,"I literally prepared for the worst on this flight as I had read some horrible reviews before my trip. Overall the trip wasn't that bad. You do get what you pay for. They tend to have the cheapest prices, but you often end up sacrificing service to save a few dollars. The planes were fairly modern and the seats were comfortable. I could not for some reason check in online due to some issues with their website and by the time I was able to do so at the airport, there were absolutely no more window seats available. Prior to the trip, I noticed they had some other website issues and they also contacted me to tell me that the fare I initially booked at was an ""error"" and I had the option of paying an additional $600 to keep my ticket. I opted to cancel instead as I found a fare that was a bit higher than what I initially booked at, but it was still much cheaper than if I had paid the additional $600. Customer service is HORRIBLE. If you call them, you wait at minimum 30 minutes to speak to a representative who sounds like they are reading from a script. They are not helpful. You are better off emailing and expect a response within 24-28 hours. My checked bag wound up with a burn hole on the front of it. There was a note that TSA inspected it, so I'm not sure if the airline did this, or TSA did it. I can't imagine how I would have a hole with the plastic around it melted from just a routine inspection or how this could have happened. My travel insurance is pursuing the matter. On board the seats were relatively comfortable and legroom was decent. The in-flight entertainment system worked and had current moves on the outbound flight. On the return, I noticed that the touch screen didn't work at the seat I sat in and the flights were pretty full going and coming, so switching seats wasn't an option. The flight attendants can come across as inattentive and aloof at times. For example, at the beginning of the flight, they passed out yellow packets containing travel socks and a toothbrush with toothpaste to passengers. They didn't finish distributing them and had not run out from what I could see and when I asked for one, I was ignored. I also asked for water at one point when the flight attendant passed with the beverage cart because I needed to take medication. She acknowledged me but had not returned within 15 minutes with my water. The food was okay, but some of it was very spicy. If you get heartburn easily, you should note this and perhaps bring antacid & snacks or request a dietary accommodation before your flight. The lavatory started out clean, but the last few hours of the flight, the floors were atrocious. The flight attendants did not seem concerned since we were due to land shortly. I agree with others that when you land in Addis Ababa it is very confusing and chaotic in the airport. We were unsure of where to go for our connecting flight and I constantly listed for an also checked the monitor for the announcements. I noticed a few times the monitor was incorrect and sometimes gates change. We also had to go downstairs at Addis Ababa to board our connecting flight and there was no staff guiding passengers on where to line up once they reached the lower level, so the downstairs escalator kept bringing people carrying luggage down and those who were already on the first floor were blocking the escalators looking around wondering where they should go and nearly got trampled by everyone on the escalator behind them. People were screaming for the people standing at the foot of the escalator to move, it was dreadful. The connecting flight to SEZ was a bit more pleasant minus three passengers who were coughing, sneezing and hocking mucus the entire 3 hour flight. It was so bad that the flight attendant asked everyone to close their eyes and cover their noses while she sprayed the entire cabin with disinfectant twice. The connecting plan was smaller and a bit less spacious. It still wasn't bad for a 3 hour flight and not horribly uncomfortable.",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

The flight out of Jeddah is known for many burquas boarding and very few getting off at the end of the flight. Then two flights on twin turboprops, both good experiences followed by the weirdest flight experience I have ever had! I had reserved a third-row window seat in coach, when I reached it, it was occupied. There was not a window at the location so it was no major problem to switch to the first seat across the aisle. Then I was asked to move over so a frail elderly man could have easier access. The flight attendants began checking tickets at that time and maybe 3 of 18 passengers in the front were in their ticketed seats! I learned from my other seatmate that people on this particular route took their assigned seating as just sort of a suggestion! After some time the crew just sort of threw up their hands so we could depart.

The plane was comfortable with good legroom and the service was also quite good. (The food was much better than it has been on other Ethiopian flights.) The one drawback is that Ethiopian has a very limited choice of new movies in its entertainment system. Those of us who have trouble sleeping on planes rely on those movies to pass the time. Another annoyance was the procedure at the gate. Those of us who were getting off connecting flights had to line up at the gate to get a colour-coded sticker to be added to our boarding pass. We then needed to line up again to board the plane.

Nov,2017.0,Much Better Experience on our Return Flight,Johannesburg,Washington DC International Business Class,"Flew from Johannesburg to Addis Ababa to Washington Dulles in business class. The first leg was on an Airbus A350-900 which was a beautiful, new aircraft and very quiet as well. The second leg was on a Boeing 777-200LR. Unlike our outbound flights, on these two, we got the seats we had reserved. Check in at JNB was slow - the check in area in Terminal A were the international carriers are located is old and dark. Once we got through security, the terminal area in JNB where the gates are is beautiful. At Addis Ababa however, it was a different story - this is not a pleasant airport to transit as it is poorly laid out, poorly marked, very crowded, very dark, and very chaotic. Boarding was not well organized at either airport.

This means you have to reclaim bagage at Frankfurt and recheck in. not funny when your 70 year olds. I thought both airlines being part of star alliance was supposed to put an end to this? - Check in at Frankfurt is a total shambles and security is getting worse. The only part that seems to work at Frankfurt is Special services - and it does magnificently!

Staff are consistently immaculate, polite but firm as a team of people committed to looking after the safety and welfare of the traveller. The decision by ET to use the Dreamliner for the route to Lusaka via Harare, is of course a great business decision. The flight from Lusaka to Addis was comfortable, with helpful staff would managed a full flight all the way up to Addis. The specifications of the plane certainly enhances that service from ET.

Nov,2017.0,My ET flight experience,Abuja,Newark International Economy,"The start of my trip to the US was good. However, my return back to Nigeria was the most hectic I have experienced in my entire lifetime. Firstly, our Return date was rescheduled without prior information. We got to the airport and got the information. The good thing was the airline made us reservations at a good hotel, with 3 meals provided and asked us to return to the airport the next day to depart EWR. The next day, we left for the airport and it was pure chaos- the airline was very disorganised and the systems were down. It took over 5 hours for all the passengers to be checked-in and our scheduled departure was delayed by 3.5 hours, meaning we had already missed our connecting flights to our final destinations at Lome. The airline handed us $150 vouchers as compensation for the rescheduled flight. We arrived Lome late and were checked into a hotel but the sad thing was that there was no flight to Abuja the next day. I will cut the extremely long story short. ET should learn to communicate timely with their offices around the world to better coordinate arrivals and transfers. Should they have informed their Lome office about the delayed departure from EWR, perhaps there could have been a better arrangement for our arrival at Lome.

Nov,2017.0,Consistently poor scheduling and service,Dar es Salaam,Addis Ababa Africa Business Class,"This is less a review about a specific flight, but rather a general review of the airline. I'm based in Addis and travel abroad often. I therefore use Ethiopian regularly, not because I want to, but because it's the only airline with direct flights to many of the African destinations I fly to. That being said, wherever possible, I try to avoid using Ethiopian because they are so consistently useless. I honestly cannot remember when last a flight of mine departed on time, or was not delayed, rescheduled, or cancelled. I'm sure I've had flights depart on schedule, it's just that I can't remember when last that happened. The on-board service is usually inept and unprofessional. Passenger requests are routinely ignored or forgotten. The cabin crew, while generally polite, are not proactive and tend to do the minimum required. The quality of the food is hit and miss. I've had some decent meals in Business Class, but more often than not, I'll just give the food a miss. The wine list is reasonably good, but they seldom have the full range on offer, and almost never bring you the right wine first time round. This happens so often it's become something of a standing joke. And while this is just a minor irritation, I mention it because it shows a lack of basic training. The airplanes themselves tend to be fine. Mostly clean, newer aircraft with decent seating and on-board entertainment systems. But on a recent flight from Dar es Salaam to Addis the plane was embarrassingly old and filthy--the type of plane that no self respecting international airline should be flying. In summary, if I have any choice at all, I fly Emirates rather than Ethiopian. Given the onerous nature of travel these days, I can do without the frustration of dealing with an incompetent carrier.",1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

I can't speak about Ethiopian's on-time performance in general (although what I hear from other travellers is favourable) but I have flown with them twice this year and they have been really excellent, both the quality of the flight, the aircraft and the timekeeping. They also have a well-functioning Star Alliance lounge in Addis although it gets crowded at rush hour. The only hassle is with their boarding procedures - the airport can be quite chaotic at times.

There were small timing adjustments to most of my flights, but one was cancelled and I was put on a flight the next day; this didn’t work for my timings so I called them up and rerouted the flight with a connection in Addis. The airline didn’t notify me of this schedule change and I only became aware of it through the My Flights app. I found the small regional airports to be very efficient. When I booked they were giving discounted rates for internal flights if you booked an international sector with them. I could only find this discount direct through their website and not through flight comparison sites. I booked the internals separately to the international sector - I didn’t need to include the internals in the same booking. I found interchange at Bole’s Terminal 1 (domestic) to be quick.

The toilets are a complete let down, very basic. It is important that these are checked frequently to ensure that they remain clean and usable. The food is bland and boring. I had the exact same meal on all four legs of my journey. THE EXACT SAME THING and not that it was well cooked in the first place. On one leg, the rice was salt-less. On another leg, it was burnt. In this day and age, it is unreasonable to expect to have shared screens, particularly for the long flights. During one of the legs of the journey, they ran out of drinking water... at least I assume that that was the situation because I kept asking for some, and did not get any.

The seating arrangement is really tight and an adult man weighting 85 kg will travel cramped and uncomfortable for the entire trip. For a company that claims to be the largest/better carrier in Africa, it is perhaps time to think about comfort especially in the medium range flights. A flight with similar duration (Addis - Frankfurt) on the Airbus A350 is a bit more comfortable. In addition in all flights, the toilettes were total pigsties! No excuses here!!! Had a few issues with checking in and boarding in Frankfurt. All caused by disorganization within the land crew. The food needs improvement!

Nov,2017.0,DUB-LAX Business Class - Well it was great Value!!,Dublin,Los Angeles International Business Class,"I recently flew Business Class DUB to LAX and LAX-DUB on Ethiopian Airlines. I am not afraid to say that I was very apprehensive before the flight. I had read many poor reviews and my expectations very not very high. The aircraft was a 787 Dreamliner and this aircraft is a joy to fly thanks to the improvements with the on-board climate. The connection to LAX is excellent, leaving at 0730 and arriving in LAX at 1030am local time. This is a big plus. The Business Class seat is adequate, it is not amazingly comfortable, but it is adequate. The seat on this 787 did not covert to the lie flat bed. As a bed it was fine and I found no issue getting a good rest. On board service is ok, a severe lack of snacks, a bit of a regimented drink service and somewhat lacklustre food service lets the experience down. Food is average and I would probably just avoid if I flew them again. The cabin crew were gracious, not overly friendly, possibly due to their lack of English. The overall experience would be similar to British Airways Club World. Aer Lingus direct from Dublin offer a better business class product.

The hot vegetarian meal was good, the second one was just a cold vegan sandwich. Service was nice. A decent price to get to Europe without the extra costs of discount airlines. Seats recline and have the standard amount of room in economy. The overhead baggage compartment seemed a little smaller than usual. Movie and TV selection included, but kind of limited.

Nov,2017.0,Never ever again,New Delhi,Tel Aviv International Economy,"On 11th Feb, I booked a return flight with Ethiopian airlines from Tel Aviv to Delhi with stop over at Addis Ababa in both directions. Original flight schedule (attached eticket) was as follows: To: ET 415, 01 October TLV 9:00AM -->ADD 1:40PM, ET 688 ADD 4:00PM --> DEL 1:05AM +1 day Return: ET 689 31 October DEL 9:10AM -->ADD 1:20PM, ET 414 ADD 4:20PM -->TLV 8:10PM So, I booked my tickets eight months in advance and I paid the full ticket price (591.9$) as usual. One month before my TLV-ADD flights, they cancelled ET688. They did not inform me, and kept saying that it is not a cancellation, it is just a time change, and the flight now leaves at 11:45 PM (instead of 4:00 PM). After long discussions they preponed my ticket to 28th September. When they said the modified ticket, it was clear that they had cancelled the flight as the new flight number (ADD-DEL) was ET 686. Anyway, during this journey, I had to wait from 1:40 PM to 11:45 PM at the ""pathetic"" ADD airport. I could still manage it because I was travelling with my husband. I came to India and on 19th October, I received an email that my return flight ET 689 is cancelled, and they are moving me to another flight ET 687 which leaves at 2:10AM (instead of 9:10AM), which would also mean another 10 hour layover at ADD. This time I am travelling alone and am not ready to go through that painful journey again, so I emailed and talked to Ethiopian customer care (all: global call centre, tel aviv call centre, and the Delhi call centre) and asked them to either give me a refund or give me a better connection. After long and tedious communications, they said they can give me flights from DEL-MUMBAI-ADD-TLV. I was ok for it but it turned out that in this I would have to claim my baggage at Mumbai and recheck in again at Mumbai (They did not tell this themselves, I had to ask specifically for this). As I am travelling alone, I do not want to do this. I informed them about this and they said they can not give a refund because it is a non-refundable tickets. I kept explaining to them that it is the airlines which has cancelled my flight and not me. Anyways, I thought I might use this one way journey during my next trip to India and asked them to change the travel date to end of March'18. Then, they said that I should pay (around 500$) for the change.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,TripAdvisor

I was wrong. Everything in the planer was aorn and torn. The food was not good, even though I asked for Asian Vegetarian hoping that the veggie alternative would be OK. It was not - and normally I eat almost anything. My co-travellers alternatives didn't seem more attractive. The only food alternative I can recommend is their fruit platter. It is hard to fail when serving fresh fruit. On the first leg of tha journey the entertainment did not produce any sound. On the second leg I got sound but the screen was frozen. When asking te crew about this I got a nice smile ""we will se what we can do, and of course nothing could be done. The flight went through Addis Abbaba which was a slum compared to any other airport I have ever been to.Even Sollefteå-Långsele Regional Airport that was closed more than 20 years ago provided better service and cleaner restrooms. The conslusion was that if you didn't get sick of the food served on the plane, a visit to the restrooms in Addis would definitely kill you off. I could actually write a special review on that airport motivating why only cattle should be allowed access. The best thing I can say about Ethiopian Airlines is that we got to our destination and the plane didn't crash. And - I forgot - their website is a joke. The make you believe that you can add pasenger info, meal preferences, passport numbers etc and then the site crashes every time you try to save what you have just entered.

This airline needs to do a lot better, the flight crew seem uninterested and didn't even try to be pleasant; the food was poor and the toilet dirty. But the worst was the transit stop at Addis Ababa. We were literally herded down stairs to the 'transit lounge' by an officious airline staff member, to what could only be described as a cattle pen. It was extremely hot and the room was packed, nowhere to sit. I had anticipated getting a cold drink whilst in transit, but there was nowhere to get anything. A dirty water cooler with dirty used cups was all that was on offer and I wasn't going to touch that. The toilets were a makeshift arrangement in a container and also dirty. We ended up being in transit for over 3 hours, by which time I felt extremely unwell due to dehydration. When we finally boarded, late, we then sat on the tarmac for over an hour as a runway was out of use. I really felt I was going to pass out from heat and thirst. And to cap it all, when we did arrive at Entebbe, our luggage had been left in Addis. Fortunately it did turn up 24 hours later, but it added to a very unpleasant experience.

Dec,2017.0,"Horrible customer service, great flight.",Washington DC,Harare International Economy,"My families experience with Ethiopian airlines has been nothing short of awful! I have already filed a complaint about my flight from Washington DC to Harare via Addis. When I boarded the plane in Washington ( after a 2.5 hr delay due to the flight being severely over booked) I noticed my seat was wet. When I was finally able to get a flight attendants attention she notified me the flight was full and there was nothing that could be done, she then gave me a plastic bag to sit on for the 13 hours flight. This is nothing short of revolting and completely unsatisfactory that I had to sit in someone else urine for 13 hours, needless to say we were connecting in Addis for our flight to Harare, which once we boarded then sat on the runway for over an hour with no explanation. We arrived at our final destination 3 hours late. On our return trip we were emailed our seat confirmations the day before we flew, yet when we arrived at the airport in Harare they told us we were flying standby from Addis to Washington, I have 2 small children, ages 5yrs and 2yrs, this was incredibly upsetting!! The Ethiopian Airlines representative assured me that we would be assigned seats in Addis and that all would be fine as he has emailed ahead to inform them. Well we left Harare and arrived in Addis (our flight was again delayed by and hour and a half). So we landed in Addis with a very short 1 hour window to get to someone to have our seats assigned, instead of the 2 hrs and 55 min lay over we were meant to have. While on the plane we asked the flight attendant what we should do as far as where we need to go to get seats assigned, she informed us that they would assign the seat at the gate to the next flight, however once inside the airport we went to the terminal to go to the gate and security told us that since we have no seats assigned we could not go to the gate that we have to go find a customer service agent. So we made our way through the airport to locate a customer service agent, which we had to wait in line for 30 mins, we finally got to the counter and were told that she could not help us that we had to go downstairs to ""transfers"". We got downstairs to only to face an ocean of people all who had been waiting over an hour with no service. Finally after another 30 minutes an Ethiopian representative took our passports without a word and left, he was gone for close to 20 minutes and finally came back with our passports and some paperwork, didn't give us any instructions, just handed them over and left. By this time we have missed our connecting flight on to Washington DC. We go through the paperwork and there is a transit visa and a hotel voucher for a hotel in the airport. We contacted the Hotel to be informed that they infect didn't not have enough beds for my family of 4, so we had to make alternate plans for accommodation as we had been given tickets to flight leaving the following night at 10:40pm. So we had 26 hrs in Addis. No one could tell us where our luggage was either. We finally found a representative for another hotel that could accommodate our family of 4 and had to pay out of pocket for the room to the total sum of US$425. This infuriated me as we were not prepared to have to pay this expense!!!!

Since my wife has a bad back, I thought it was reasonable to spend a little more to be sure she would be comfortable. Ethiopian Air’s flight from Toronto to Addis had lay flat seats, attentive service, good food, and a comfortable environment. It was nicer than many full priced business class flights I’ve been on when traveling for my company. Given the level of service, and the price I paid, I considered the flight an incredible value. Two things that were less than stellar: the choice of liquor was limited and the entertainment system had fewer choices than I’m used to. I will say that these are quibbles. One important point: we arrived late into Addis and were transferred directly from our flight to our subsequent flight on a bus. Our luggage made it, and we saved time, but it was disconcerting. This allowed us to miss the Addis Airport, which is uncomfortable so in some senses it was a plus.

But we paid a good price for the service we received from the airline. My 11 year old daughter was able to get her lunch after serving time as she was sleeping when they served the meal. I appreciated that. I must mention: we somehow got the time difference wrong in Ethiopia and were late for our connecting flight to Cairo.

Dec,2017.0,A most unpleasant experience.,Hong Kong,Entebbe International Economy,"We flew 4 legs on Ethiopian in mid-December 2017 and early January 2018. Leg 1 was Hong Kong to Addis Ababa. About 1 hour into the flight, at 2.30 am HKG time, the cabin lights were switched on and a meal was served. The lights were kept on after the meal. This was not helpful when trying to sleep. The toilet doors on the Dreamliner were of a flimsy design and required a knack to open (Thai Airways’ Dreamliner had proper doors). The meals were not particularly appetizing and the staff service unimpressive. After a 10 hour 30 min flight, at Addis we were directed to a transit lounge, which consisted of long rows of seats. Apart from the toilet block, there were no amenities at all. Nowhere to buy a drink, something to eat or even a magazine to look at. See the photo. The male toilet area was one of the worst it has ever been my misfortune to encounter. A converted shipping container, it contained four cubicles. The seat in the first I entered had been trashed and was not usable. I was advised/begged by the exiting user of the second cubicle not to enter it because, despite trying for five minutes, he had been unable to flush it. I didn’t have the courage to attempt the other two cubicles. Leg 2, after 4 hours in the pen, was in a Boeing 737 which has a seat pitch of 31 inches. Not comfortable. The pilot advised that because of extension work to the runways, it would be some time before we took off. It was an hour and a quarter. At 31-inch pitch. Upon arrival at Entebbe, we found that our checked luggage had been left at Addis Ababa. Leg 3 was Entebbe-Addis, again by 31-inch pitch Boeing 737. This flight was uneventful. Leg 4 was Addis-Bangkok. We avoided the pen and found a more conventional, if drab, departure hall. Boarding was to be through Gate 13. An hour before take-off, an official gathered us passengers together and moved us to Gate 10, which turned out to be a wide glass-lined passage with seats for about 25% of the passengers. We were then collected by another official, who took us to Gate 9 for the actual boarding. The Dreamliner flight was pretty much the same as that from HKG-ADD except this time the cabin lights were switched off after the meal.

Our flights to SEZ (via Addis Ababa) were in a smallish airplane and there were no individual screens. Instead a small screen came down from the top of the aircraft after every 3 or 4 seats and we were forced to watch what they showed.

An hour passes by and it's time to serve lunch. The same flight attendant does a double take (she forgot?!?!) when I unlatched the tray table and it falls to my lap (again). Hmmm...am I going to hold the food tray and eat with both hands or do I just put the food tray on my lap?! She creatively gives me 2 blankets to put on my lap as support for the broken tray table.

I don’t care how nice it was though, I did not make the flight I was promised to make - on 3 occasions when I asked. Then they lost all my luggage. All. Of. It. And the EA representatives in the US said they can’t see the luggage because their system is not compatible with the one in Addis. Then, my connecting flight in DC was missed, and I was told it was rescheduled- it was not. Absolutely the worst airline I have flown on. Then!!! In trying to find my ticket, the US rep asked why I flew through Heathrow to get to DC. I didn’t. Their system actually had my ticket touting through London. What kind of security is that!?

Three of our four planes were new but the Tel Aviv to Addis leg had one of the older ones with no tvs. However we boarded after midnight so it actually wasn't an issue - just a surprise. As always we were happy with the service on board (with the exception of the Kosher meals - provided from Antwerp. With the identical meal for three of the 4 legs, not always appropriate for the time of day/night and, unfortunately it has to be said, really not edible. (so if you have to choose Kosher - take something with in case.) In fact - always take something with - incl a change of clothing - because on 2 of our trips in past years we had to stay over - and were put up in hotels. The main issue/frustration - the boarding process in Ethiopia. And the boarding seating areas where the chair rows aren't secured. In theory calling by zones is ideal - but in practice - you have people boarding from front and back and not zone specific. And on one of the flights zones were called but the bus didn't come and everyone had to stand in a limited area downstairs - forget queues - the passengers were backed up the stairs. So organizational strategies still need to be worked on. Nonetheless I would, for the value IF there is a short layover - fly Ethiopian again.

We had to fill out forms and leave our card numbers and passport copies at the checkin counter - big note here to American Express, this breaks pretty much all the guidelines for PCI compliance with card numbers hand written with all details and signatures on bits of paper. Really not acceptable either. The service was good, just the procedures are well behind what should be acceptable now especially from major airports.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor
Dec,2017.0,Friendly professional staff!,Toronto,Cape Town Central International Economy,"Leaving Toronto mid morning meant the first part of flight was during the day. Food and drinks were served steadily and although I didn’t have a special meal the food was edible. I didn’t use the inflight entertainment so I’m not sure about that ...my unit was working and people all around seemed to be using them.the flight was 13 hours long which is a long time fortunately it was only the last 2 hours that made it feel long...I don’t know if the leg room is bigger than other airlines but it felt more comfortable than others. Landing in Addis Ababa in the morning was a great way of seeing the countryside. My connecting flight was 1 hour after my arrival and I was concerned it was not going to be enough time...the arrival gate was very close to the departure gate and with an hour delay on the 2nd leg I had no trouble at all. Being Christmas time the airport was very full. My second leg was 6 hours and seemed like a breeze compared to the first. The time difference meant I was ready for a nap,and managed to get one between another few meals. All in all I would fly this route again...and would choose Ethiopian Air given the option.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Dec,2017.0,"Efficient , No Complaints",Toronto,Johannesburg International Business Class,"Flew on Dec 22 , layover was tight when we booked 1h20 and then with flight changes was 50 mins about two weeks out . In order to prepare for a potential layover I contacted an agency to schedule a tour on arrival , decided which restaurant we would eat in that night and had a hotel option in event I was not happy with hotel the airline may provide. We basically decided once we were advised of he shortened transit time that we accept whatever happened as we couldn't change it and take the opportunity to c Addis as we would still arrive before Christmas . I was anxious as it was winter, but on check agent reassured us the flights always land at least half hour early in Addis. Bags were tagged short transit in Addis as well as Priority tags. Prior to departure weather was an issue and plane had to be de-iced. Plane took off 50 mins after scheduled time so off course we fully expected to miss our connection to JNB. In- Flight no issues. FA personable , toilets always clean. Seats meh ! I prefer AC and Emirates pods and even SAA seats are way better. Food good. Due to good tailwinds pilot made up time lost on ground in Toronto but we landed 20 minutes before our connecting flite was to depart. The purser had advised us in-flight we would be transferred directly to the next flight. If it was any other International Airport we would not have made it, however ground staff were waiting for connecting passengers with short connection and there were 4 buses waiting . About 10 of us were on the JNB connection and the plane was held for us and took off twenty minutes late . It seems EA does this quite frequently . Despite making the connection , I do not think I would do this route with a 50 minute transit time and definitely never in the winter or with children in tow. It's a bit too stressful lol. On arrival in JNB , our bag was last on the carousel and in addition one bag did not make the transfer . This was annoying and stressful however the bag was delivered to our door intact and undamaged the next day. 4 other passengers on that short transfer also did not receive their bags . Another reason I would hesitate to do this route in view of the short transfer. Anything less than 2 hours is dicey imo. I decided to post this review as most reviews on EA have been negative and for those reading them it is stress inducing . Overall we had a positive experience , but I went on this trip expecting an awful 18 hours and it was fine . Be positive , accept it's beyond your control and if u choose to book EA allow yourself an extra day as u should assume with all these reviews that u more than likely will be in transit longer than u expected in ADD. Now, I'm hoping my return leg is uneventful , but I'm planning that it may be my one opportunity to c ADD 😂",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Dec,2017.0,Great flight at a great price,Toronto,Johannesburg International Economy,"I was apprehensive about flying with Ethiopian but was assured by others that the flight was great. And it was! Although we took off an hour late which gave cause for concern as our connection in Addis to Johannesburg was only a hour in between flights, staff assured us that we would be ok. Besides for 2 howling kids in the area around us, (simply bad parenting not the air stewards fault) the flight to Addis was uneventful. Kosher food ordered was edible. Air stewards were polite and engaging. The transfer in Addis was a bit weird as we deplaned onto the tarmac and had to wait for busses to take us to the terminal. A quick walk to the correct gate and we boarded the next flight with no problem. Again an uneventful flight to Johannesburg. Kosher food this time was inedible...came from Amsterdam. No problem as the air stewards found us vegetarian options very quickly. We flew Boeing 777’s each flight so plenty of legroom and no issues with carryon luggage. Price was about 50% cheaper than Delta from Atlanta and in fact quicker I would definitely recommend this route My only issue was the kosher food on the second flight or it would have been a 10",5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,TripAdvisor
Dec,2017.0,A very good airline,London,Victoria International Business Class,"We flew from London Heathrow via Addis Ababa to Mahé, Seychelles. Our booking was for economy seats but with Ethiopian you can bid for cloud nine (business class) upgrades for unsold seats. When flew business on 3 of the 4 legs. The service on board was outstanding for all legs and In business class the food was excellent. A good selection of meals and drinks on tap for the duration of the flight. On the Addis - Heathrow leg the seats weee fully reclining, lay flat beds, easily capable of allowing a person 6’ tall to stretch out and sleep in comfort. My only criticism was that the temperature fluctuated a bit so I was throwing my blanket on and off. Overall a great experience for a long haul fligjt",4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,TripAdvisor
Dec,2017.0,Shocking disorganization,Toronto,Cape Town Central International Economy,"We had 4 Air Ethiopia flights between Toronto and Capetown, there and back. Not a single flight was on time, and as a result we missed every connection. This resulted in us having to stay an extra 24 hours in Addis Ababa (automatically missing one day of our short holiday, getting violently sick and being unable to keep any food down for a further two days after that (thereby effectively missing a further 2 days of our short holiday). On the way back the missed flight resulted in a further half a days loss, and one of our cases was lost for over a week. I am not even going to waste my time reviewing just how badly the missed flights were handled. Suffice it to say in all cases that there were hundreds of irate customers, plenty of shouting, pushing and shoving, and even outright fighting. This was directly as a result of the ineptness of the Air Ethiopia reps. Shocking, just shocking. I would avoid travelling this airline at all costs. We picked it because of the price - and we paid the price, and then some. In the future we will pay more to avoid this route.",3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor
Dec,2017.0,Nice connections to Africa on board Dreamliner,Newark,Lome International Economy,"I was connecting to Ethiopian Airlines as part of my journey from New Orleans to Lagos. I was flying Ethiopian from Newark to Lomé. Ethiopian had recently started this route as part of their connection to their Star Alliance partner United, which has a hub at Newark. I have flown Ethiopian before and had a pleasant experience so I was looking forward to this flight. Ethiopian Airlines is one of the major carriers serving Africa and have really integrated the Dreamliner aircraft into their operations, especially from the U.S. Even though they partner with Star Alliance members, you cannot book connections through Ethiopian’s website; instead you have to go through partner or third-party websites. After you book through these websites, it is somewhat difficult to manage your booking through the website; instead you have to call the airline to request seat assignments, special meals, and adding frequent flyer numbers. This part of the process is very inconvenient. As I was connecting to Ethiopian from a partner airline, this is the process I had to follow. The flight from Newark was scheduled to depart at 9:15p and arrive into Lomé at 12p for a scheduled flight time of 9h45m. I was able to check-in online and receive my boarding pass, but because I was transferring from another airline I had to check-in again at the boarding gate to confirm my boarding pass and receive an Ethiopian Airlines boarding pass. Boarding was scheduled to begin at 8:15p, an hour prior to the scheduled departure time, so I arrived at the gate around 8p. The plane was already there, but the crew were still outside so it looked like we were not going to have an on-time departure. Boarding started around 8:45p and passengers were supposed to board by groups. It was extremely chaotic and slow process; in fact, each time I have boarded with Ethiopian it has been chaotic and slow process. After a lengthy wait, in which the gate attendant threatened to discontinue boarding as passengers were not compliant, we finally boarded the plane. The operating aircraft was a Boeing 787-900 Dreamliner with a small-ish business class and two sections of economy. The economy seats were in a 3-3-3 layout which made the plane feel less dense. As stated earlier, boarding was extremely slow and chaotic. At 9:15p, our scheduled departure time, passengers were still boarding the plane. Around 9:30p, all passengers had been boarded and we were finally able to push back; while the two economy sections were completely full, there were only two passengers in business class. A safety video was shown, and after a slow taxi and wait, we finally took-off. Even though it was a Dreamliner plane, it felt like an older version based on the PTV screens and the seat comfort. The seat width was decent but the seat comfort was extremely poor; it was uncomfortable from when you sat down and got even more uncomfortable as the flight progressed. On the seatback was a PTV screen, with controls in the armrest (again, who thought that was a good idea?!?). Underneath the PTV screen was a USB port and the headphone jack was located in the armrest. Below the PTV screen was the tray table and below that was the seatback pocket which contained the duty free magazine, the airline magazine, and the safety card. As you boarded, a blanket and pillow were already provided on each seat. The PTVs were active from the moment you boarded, which is something I think all airlines should do. This allows you to not only decide what you want to watch, but it also keeps most passengers occupied so they are not paying attention to delays. The selection on Ethiopian was limited – while they had a decent selection of movies, their TV selection was extremely poor. It was a struggle to find enough programs to watch. As soon as we passed 10,000 feet, the attendants got up to start their service. Headphones were passed out while we were still on the ground, and once in the air amenity kits were passed out. It is a very nice touch that Ethiopian still provides amenity kits to all passengers – economy amenity kits include a pair of socks, an eye mask, tooth brush, and tooth paste. About an hour later, specially requested meals were served and then the carts were brought out to serve dinner and drinks. There was a choice of chicken or pasta, and complimentary drinks were served including soft drinks, juices, and alcohol. The serving size for the food was good, but the quality and flavor was a bit lacking. It wasn’t the worst meal, but definitely not the best either. Afterwards, tea and coffee were provided and then the lights were dimmed so passengers could rest. During the flight, the seatbelt sign was off so passengers to move freely as they wanted. Water and drinks were available throughout the flight in the galleys, but no snacks were available. Attendants were always available in the galley, but they rarely passed through the cabin. About two hours prior to landing, the lighting in the cabin changed to signal morning and to wake passengers up. The attendants came by with their breakfast service – a meal and complimentary juice, tea, or coffee. Again, the serving size was decent but the quality and flavor were lacking. After the meal trays were cleared, we started our decent into Lomé. As we departed late, we landed behind schedule. Luckily it was a quick taxi to the gate, but it took some time for the door to be opened. Those passengers who were continuing onto Addis were to stay onboard while those who were connecting to other flights in Lomé deplaned. Overall, it was an average experience onboard Ethiopian. The seat comfort was definitely poor so it made it hard to rest and sit for the flight period. Other items that needed improvement were the boarding process, the meal quality, the meal flavor, and the entertainment selection. Positives include access to USB ports, a less dense plane, traveling on a Dreamliner which provides a better overall service, access to Star Alliance partners, easy connections with Africa, and a general ease of traveling within Africa. Ethiopian is on track to become the biggest airline within Africa, and while their service has slipped a bit, they still provide a good service and good connections.",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Dec,2017.0,Use Ethiopian Airlines at your peril,Cape Town Central,New Delhi International Business Class,"We flew to Delhi from Cape Town via Addis Ababa and back this month (December 2017) and were shocked that this airline could be rated the best in Africa. The economy class cabin on the first flight from CTIA to what passes for an international airport in Addis was filthy. Arm-rests were caked with the grime that stays after years of no cleaning. The seat pockets were filled with food and bread crumbs and rubbish and the tray table in front of my partner was broken. The ""entertainment system"" worked only intermittently. Chaos on the ground and incompetent and untrained ground staff at Addis led to us and another passenger being taken to the terminal building instead of on to another aircraft for the flight to Delhi. We had confirmed bookings and boarding tickets and our luggage was flown onto Delhi. When we found an official who could speak some English and was willing to help, he admitted that a ""bad mistake"" had been made and immediately issued transport, food and accommodation vouchers and boarding passes for a flight later that day. We were taken to a hotel in the centre of Addis where we rested and contemplated the error of flying EA. Sleep was impossible due to the noise of nightclubs. We eventually reached Delhi where no-one from EA could be found to indicate what had happened to our luggage. Was it still on a belt after nearly 24 hours? No it was on a trolley where we found it by chance in the Delhi terminal. Thank heavens the threat to blow up unaccompanied baggage appears to be just that. Although were given good seats with extra legroom on the flight to Delhi from Addis, the experience was spoilt by rowdy (drunken or drugged) passengers who took up the empty seats behind us and kicked out seats, banged on tray tables and generally behaved like hooligans for 4 hours. Despite our discomfort, the cabin crew took no notice. The return flights from Delhi to Johannesburg via Addis were not so bad but ground arrangements in Addis were hopeless with groups of passengers for various flights held on the tarmac under armed guard while buses were found to ferry them to other aircraft.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Next day we caught our flight to Cape town. On reaching Capetown, our 1 baggage was missing. After 3 days of follow up, the baggage was finally found and returned Capetown - Mumbai The flight had layover at Addis Ababa. Again on reaching Addis Ababa, we were told that Mumbai flight had left, and we will be sent to New Delhi after 4 hours and from there to Mumbai, totaling a delay of more than 12 hours. On reaching Mumbai, this time the entire baggage were missing. After 2 days of rigorous follow ups, the baggage was found, couriered to my address. Upon checking my bags, i found that all my valuables like watches, perfumes etc were missing.

The service was good however the food was inedible. Luckily I always carry a large bag of nuts. I did not eat any of the food. however I must say the wines and champagne were good. The flat bed was not comfortable and had a scratchy material. The Addis to Toronto flight was a 777 and looked worn. The pilots are good and we did not crash. That is the main thing. The major problem was that it took them 2 hours from landing in Toronto to clear my luggage so I could get through US Immigration. The US demands pictures of the luggage in order to board. Go figure. I missed the Toronto to LAS flight and was stuck in the airport for an extra 12 hours. It took around 42 hours to get to LAS from SEZ and was suppose to take 29 hours. The airport at Addis is a dump and the economy line for security was huge. The only reason I took Ethiopian was that the flight times were good.

Immigration line was sooo looong. The business class lounge was ok. Had mountain dew and fruits and samosa. The leather seats were nice and comfy. They announced the flight and the boarding gate was in chaos. A fellow passenger blocked me from boarding and inquired if I was with family, when I said I was in business he went in front of me (he seemed to be also a business class passenger, i think). Boarding line was crazy but Hakuna Matata. I was seated on the aisle seat but transferred to a window seat. I was preparing to sleep when the flight attendant asked if I wanted to be woken up for the meal service. I of course answered yes. The seat was very hard and difficult to recline. The plane was old but the service of the flight attendants were good enough to compensate for the old plane. I slept and slept.

The food quality is low. -- In November, again on a flight from Dulles to Addis, myself and 3 other customers asked to shift our seats -- because our row smelled strongly of urine. 2 flight attendants denied that they smelled anything, and didn't want to help us.

In other words, Ethiopian knew they had a problem before the flight left the ground, and ignored it. The havoc and stench from this result were both significant. The food was, once again, truly awful, and often inedible. As with my November flight, I turned down the final meal offering.

I was transiting at Addis Ababa airport between a flight from Cape Town to another to Hong Kong (both operated by Ethiopian). Knowing that the connection was tight, I asked the airline agent at the foot of the aeroplane stairs where I should go to connect to Hong Kong and was pointed onto a waiting bus. This took me to the terminal and after running through security I was told that I had missed my connection and would have to wait 24 hours until the next flight BUT that I should have taken a different bus that would have taken me directly to the Hong Kong flight! I later discovered that some HK passengers had been pointed to the correct bus and other hadn't. One wonders why they didn't announce to all passengers that there would be a direct bus - instead they kept it a secret and even pointed me onto the wrong bus.

Jan,2018.0,the worst customer service,Cape Town,Riyadh,"Cape Town to Riyadh via Addis Ababa. I fly regularly with Ethiopian Airlines for reasons of trip time. The staff are very friendly but the airline has the worst customer service. The return leg of the flight Cape Town - Addis Ababa - Riyadh flight was changed in itinerary in 2017 so that the all of the connecting international flights from Addis to Riyadh are 20 minutes after landing. The connecting flight includes a bus transfer to Terminal 2 and then a bus transfer from terminal 2 to terminal 1 (no direct option). This transfer time takes on average 40 minutes from time of landing (I have done this flight for 4 years 4-6 times a year) this means that the airline sells transfer / connecting flights that are impossible to catch. The first time I was caught out on this trip I ended up spending 9 hours in terminal 1 (a terminal that is not fit for international travellers in terms of cleanliness and facilities). On this occasion I had to wait 5 hours before anyone could tell me that a replacement flight could be obtained and waited an additional 4 hours for the next flight. The next time I flew this route after seeking assurance from the customer services that I could make the connecting flight, I ended up staying 24 hours and it took more than 12 hours before any representative could tell me; 1 if i would be getting another flight and 2 in this case a hotel. The local representative took my passport and returned it 12 hours later. Even now, if I phone and speak to supervisors of the airline they assure me that a 20 minute stopover on an international flight is acceptable. This means anyone on this flight will need the pilot to land in excess of 1 hour early. This is the issue with flights - however the real tragedy and stunning lack of assistance comes when trying to redeem airmiles. Having tried for 5 hours once with online assistance and 5 phone calls to Ethiopia South Africa and Saudi local offices, the transaction was not able to complete without a visit to a local branch - thus 3 hours online 2 hours of telephone calls and 1 and a half hours of trip to local office to get a single return flight – 6 and a half hours of time including lost working time. On a trip to South Africa in January this year I tried to upgrade my ticket to business class. This could not be achieved online so after 2 hours on the phone the assistant could not take payment of any of my credit cards. This left me with no option but to travel into central Cape Town to pay. On a separate occasion in the beginning of 2017 I received a (false) email message on a Saturday that my return flight to Saudi Arabia was being brought forward by 1 day. After 3 hours attempting to contact Ethiopian airlines locally and internationally (no answer local or on the international toll number) and a trip to the airport we found out the email was incorrect. I am not joking when I say that the list goes on. But systems that don’t work, false instructions impossible connections and lack of ability to contact or get assistance, staff not picking up telephones, local toll free numbers that do not work etc. mean that this airline is a disaster for the traveller.",2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

Jan,2018.0,no hesitation in recommending,London,Zanzibar,"London to Zanzibar via Addis Ababa. My wife and I have travelled from UK to Zanzibar, typically once a year since 2001 and have just made our 17th such round trip, and for a second time with Ethiopian Airlines through Addis Abba. The service we received on all four legs was excellent with new A350 aircraft on all but ADD - ZNZ which was a Boeing 787-8, that although it was beginning to look a little tired in places, was nevertheless a great aircraft to fly on. However the A350 is even better and noticably quieter especially when climbing after takeoff. Our four flights took off on time and arrived either on time or early. The standard service in Economy was both efficient and courteous, and could put other better known airlines covering the same destination via the Middle East that we have used, to shame. The food and beverage offer was better than one often finds on long haul economy and was served with charm by attentive cabin crews that clearly they wanted to be of service. As one might expect on the such a modern fleet of aircraft, the touch-screen in-flight entertainment worked well, was intuitive to use, and offered an excellent range of films and audio. Ingeniously, some days before departure Ethiopian Airlines invited on line bids to upgrade to ""Cloud 9"" business class on each leg, and we made an ""offer"" for the upgrade on the final ADD-LHR leg which was accepted. This gave us access to the comfortable ""Cloud 9"" lounge for the 5 hour layover between flights on the return which was very welcome. At some 7800ft above sea level, Addis Abba airport is in fact a very acceptable airport hub, though without the glitz and resultant high prices often found. An unusual and welcome feature are the various ""quiet"" areas around the terminal to while-away time between flights that have chaise-longue to stretch out full length on, as well as more conventional seats It is perhaps unusual to experience an airline's ""economy"" and ""business"" class offerings back to back on similar A350 aircraft, but we can confirm that ""Cloud 9"" compares very well with other long haul airlines that we have used previously. Based on our experience we would have no hesitation in recommending Ethiopian Airlines as an effective way to reach the increasingly popular holiday destination of Zanzibar from the UK and would expect to use them again for our next trip there.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,AirlineQuality

Jan,2018.0,should communicate with their passengers,Addis Ababa,Los Angeles,"Flew Ethiopian Airlines from Addis Ababa to Los Angeles. I went on holiday and flew with them twice and each time was frustrating. The attendants are rude and have an attitude about anything you ask them. During my first flight, I asked four different people for water and waited for over half an hour with nothing. I had to get up and go to the back, where they were all just sitting and talking. I proceeded to get my own water while they all looked at me. Then on the way back from my trip, we were told our flight was on time. Then we were told it was delayed 30 minutes due to a small issue. Then we heard nothing for two hours. My sister and I were travelling together. I bought our tickets together and specifically requested that we are seated together. I asked an attendant to change my seat since I specifically requested two seats together. She told me the flight was full and I should look in the computer myself to find a seat that was together. I went to another attendant on the place and she said there were many extra seats so she had no problem getting me two seats next to each other. Also, my flight was supposed to be a straight flight from Ethiopia to LAX but somehow we ended up in Dublin. I understand that they need to stop and refuel but they should communicate with their passengers. The Dublin authority came on the plane and requested to see all our boarding passes and passports and they made us get up to search through all our seats.

Jan,2018.0,The worst ever,Johannesburg,Bahrain International Economy,"It was shocking how this airline deliberately plans its connections for passengers to miss their onward flights. Our flight from Johannesburg departed an hour late. We only had a connection gap of 45 min at Addis Ababa even if the flight departed on time. We noticed that all of their onward connections had a similar gap or less. Our return flight had a connection gap of just 15 min. Naturally we missed our connecting flight from AA to Bahrain. Addis Ababa is the most disorganized and chaotic airport I have ever been to in all of my travels and I travel a lot. None of the airport staff were even willing to give us directions to gates. And those that gave us directions mislead us. After struggling for over an hour with our 2 year old child, we made it to the counter that deals with lay over passengers. The queue at the counter was so long. People were shouting and screaming at the way they were being treated. Everyone going everywhere was stranded at this airport. And the locals I spoke to tell me that this airline thrives on chaos and is an everyday affair. We joined the queue at 7pm and eventually fought our way (as was the norm) to the front of the counter at 09:20pm. They collected our passports and promised to put us on the Gulf Air flight that was scheduled to depart at 05am the next morning. They collected our passports and gave us meal vouchers after repeatedly asking the lady at the counter. They sent us to a lounge which looked like a run down cafeteria. The food was the worst. Rice and a veg curry. We bought biscuits and sat up the whole night waiting for our Gulf Air flight. At 2am I decided to check on the situation. Once again I had to fight my way through the queues. When I got to the front (embrace yourselves) they lost our passports. Yes they actually did. At 4am they managed to trace it back. We rushed from pillar to post carrying our 2 year old and all of our luggage as we were once again mislead when asked for departure gates. We eventually got to the gate and were waiting to board. As the flight pulls up on the run way they tell us that they cannot accommodate us on that flight due to lack of seats. Frustrated and exhausted after spending nearly 13 hours at this horrible airport, we accepted hotel accommodation. We told them that we would need our checked in luggage as our next flight out to Bahrain was only 2 days later and we didn't even have enough clothes on us. The lady said that they did not have a luggage tracking system and that she would have to take our luggage tag and physically search for our bags among a pile of thousand other bags and that would take at least 2 hours or more. We decided to abandon our luggage since we were beyond exhausted and we just wanted to get a room and shower and get some food for our child. It's 5am and we step out of the airport where we were promised that our shuttle to the hotel would be waiting. It was pitch dark and there was nobody in sight. We walked down the road only to be surrounded by groups of strange men who's intentions we weren't sure of. Luckily a taxi driver came by as a good Samaritan and offered to call the hotel for us from his phone. The shuttle arrived half an hour later and took us to what looked like a prison way out of the city. After arriving at the hotel and unpacking I decided to walk to the nearest supermarket. A cab driver offered to drive me there for 150 Birr. When we reached the supermarket he said it was 150 USD and not Birr. I decided to pay him the USD 150 as I didn't want trouble and walked back to the hotel. It doesn't end here. The challenges we had on our way back was a whole different ordeal on its own and the space here doesn't allow me to elaborate on those. Stay away from them.",3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor
Jan,2018.0,Bad experience on flight and at Addis connection.,London,Nairobi International Economy,"Fly Ethiopian Airlines and start your trip with a bad experience. Very quickly you realize that the cheap airfare is not worth the aggravation on flight and at Addis. The airplanes were modern, and clean. But the experience of dealing with the airplane staff and connection at Addis were just too difficult. An Ethiopian male passenger started to be offensive, and physically assaulted another female passenger. The airplane should have been diverted to the nearest airport and this passenger should have been removed from the flight. But it was not done and the flight crew just tried to calm the individual. The airport at Addis does not have the capacity to handle large number of passengers in-transit. The people working at the hub are not properly trained, do not seem to understand English, and seem to be scared as if someone was watching them. They always seemed to answer a question with a ""reply question"", but never a simple answer. The airport does not have sufficient choice of restaurants, shopping, etc. Just trying to make a telephone call was difficult, as the payphones didn't work. The connection flights from Addis did not exist. It appears it was a just a trick to get people to book flights via Addis, by getting travellers misled into believing there was onward flights to final destinations with a short stop in Addis.

Water only came if you asked for it, not offered at regular intervals as in most overseas flights. The food just wasn't worth shouting about. I refused my third meal...enough was enough.

Enough drinks and handing out of blankets and so on. The aeroplanes are very different. Not always good screens but what they offer for entertainment is a bit meagre. Not really my taste. On our way back we had an extreme delay. We had to wait in Gaborone for a very long time. Just within limits so they did not have to hand out beverages..... but we did miss our connecting flight to Frankfurt. Addis Abbaba is chaos and even more chaos if you missed your flight. We did not really know where to go and got to a desk where they redirected us. We got a flight to London but now we were really in a hurry in all this chaos. This airport is really, really bad. Blockes toilets, lots of people everywhere. It is really crowded and gives a traveller a lot of unneccesay stress. Well we did arrive in London and got our flight to Amsterdam but part of our luggage did not. I guess our luggage has been send to Frankfurt and it was delayed....

Jan,2018.0,Absolutely worst customer service experience of my life,Addis Ababa,Cape Town Central Africa Economy,"I consider myself well-traveled, and do not shy away from budget airlines. I know I pay for what I'm getting and adjust expectations accordingly. However, Ethiopian Airlines has a level of un-professionalism that surpassed even my rock bottom expectations. Prepare yourself for the customer experience nightmare Part 1 of 3. I realized a month before my departure date that I had to cancel my flight. I called the Dar es Salaam Ethiopian office daily for a week, and finally got hold of someone, Charles D. He recommended switching to email to clarify details and I acquiesced. I emailed him. One week later, nothing. Two weeks later, I cancel the flight online and send another email asking about partial reimbursement (which the website promises). I call again. Still nothing. After daily calling for a week, finally get in touch with Samira who replies to my email. She says it may take up to a week for the amount to be credited. (Spoiler alert: This happened in December 2017 and as of June 2018, I have received no reimbursement in my account). Now we get a brief interlude for Part 2. I had booked a flight from Ethiopia to South Africa that needed a change (these flights were for work) because business meeting times changed. The change was noted within the 24-hour time frame which Ethiopian Air PROMISES will be a full reimbursement. What they don't tell you, is though you'll be fully reimbursed the amount, you will ALSO be charged a change fee of $100. I emailed Samira about this and she emailed back, asking if I was sure I had booked the flight. Um...yes. I was forced to pay this charge out of pocket and she told me unfortunately, I had no other options. Let's go back to Part 1. Around this time I get another email from Samira, warning me that if I do not cancel my original flight, I will be charged a no show fee. Yes--the flight I had already cancelled. The flight that I had been promised that I would be refunded partially for. Still no refund, and on top of that, they're going to charge me more money?!? I tried to call YET AGAIN with no reply. Fine, I think to myself, I will try when I get back in the USA. Have called the customer service again twice since being in the States, the number is apparently no longer working. Have also submitted messages through their general inquiry form on their website, still no response. I don't think I will ever be partially reimbursed; this has been the longest 'week' of my life. The amount to be reimbursed was around $200, but now, the sunk cost I've put in to try to get that $200 feels above and beyond the original price. Part 3: Almost to the end of this saga. The aforementioned flight from Addis Ababa to Cape Town had arrived. I get to the airport. Get in line. I'm talking casually with the people around me, and since my flight was leaving first, the other passengers in the line extremely kindly (side note, cannot extol how generous the people I met in Ethiopia are) let me move to the front. I'm standing at the front desk, but the lady there won't receive me. She keeps pointing to the people behind me who all keep pointing at me, because it really was an unanimous vote that I should move to the front. She finally rolls her eyes and says I can come to the desk. I give her my passport. She looks at it, looks at something in the computer and walks away with it. I mean, past the desks, out of my line of sight. ""Excuse me!"" I say. ""What's happening?"" She replies that it's nothing and none of my concern....It's my flight. It's my passport. YES it's my concern. She comes back, still saying nothing. I try to ask again what's happening, she again says nothing. Someone more senior comes over and she gives her my passport and that woman walks away. At this point, I am very frustrated, it's been 15 minutes, my flight is indeed very soon which was why the others in line allowed me to move in front, and I have no idea what's wrong. She finally points and tells me to ask the senior person whom she gave my passport. I do--and guess what? They had overbooked the flight and moved me to the next one. That is fine. That is, with no sarcasm, a-okay with me; I understand the basic economy life, understand that this is what airplanes think they must do to make the most money at the expense of the customers. What is NOT okay is how she left me completely in the dark, how my fear and apprehension escalated and grew until I was almost in tears, unsure what had happened, what was wrong, what was going on, what I would do, how I would get in contact with my organization or my family and her clear apathy to my anxiety. If I can help it, I will never fly Ethiopian internationally again. They have me lost me as a customer, and I warn you to fly with extreme caution and ONLY book a flight if you have no doubt in your mind that you will cancel or change even the smallest detail.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Jan,2018.0,Very Pleasantly Surprised with Service,Toronto,Cape Town Central International Economy,"We booked this long flight (11-14 hrs depending on direction) with Ethiopian Airlines with a little trepidation, not haven flown with them previously. We were surprised at the level of service. We flew both ways on their Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes, which we found to be pretty comfortable. Check in, cabin crews, meals, schedules were all equivalent or better than other airlines we have flown across oceans on. We had ordered special meals and they were there for all our flights. They seemed to feed us every few hours so lots of food but sometimes the quality was a bit lacking. I was a bit concerned about only having 1 hour to transfer planes in Addis Ababa and whether either us or our luggage would get left behind but we found it all worked out well with our luggage and making our connections. Would definitely fly with them again. An extra bonus was that there was no cost for any drinks which doesn’t happen too often on economy flights any more.",4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Jan,2018.0,Cheap but solid service and flight,Cape Town Central,London International Economy,"My girlfriend and I decided we would book all one way tickets to 6 countries for a 74 day adventure. We found the cheapest flights to fit into our budget was Ethiopian airlines and could not find much information on this company and if we did it was either very negative or positive no in between. So we took two international flights with Ethiopian airlines. One was from Athens, Greece to Cape Town and the other from Cape Town to London England. We got these flights at an amazing deal for Canadian dollars. The seats are nothing special, just your basic leather seats but they recline and not like Ryanair bucket seats. Second the food options aren’t too shabby and once again it’s a airplane not a 5 star restaurant and economy class. The flight itself was smooth and the service from the flight attendants was good. Would I recommend flying with them, defiantly! Why you might ask? Well my girlfriend and later myself got food poisoning the day we were flying out! The extent of her food poisoning was unreal and she could not sit in her seat for an 8 hour flight. The attendants lets her sit in a chair and floor beside the bathroom (not obstructing it from other passengers), supplied her with fluid and food. When we landed they had called ahead about medical treatment (which isn’t the best place to be treated but they supplied us with what they had for free in the Ethiopian airport) then got her a wheelchair and supplied her with a place to sleep. On our connecting flight they once again gave her excellent treatment and for one, I know some Canadian airlines that wouldn’t have gone to this extent to help! I would say congrats to the company and training diligent folks with a good sense of compassion/ respect. Keep up the good work and if you need a cheap flight look no further.

Jan,2018.0,Business Class on an Airbus 777-200LR,Washington DC,Addis Ababa International Business Class,"The seating in Business Class as 2-3-2 meaning the seats were a little narrow (for me - a fairly large person at 215lbs and 5'10"". The seat-to-seat distance was not too large either, so the seat back in the horizontal position had something of a slope, so there was a tendency to slide down, but then the feet went into a fairly narrow space that was a little tight for them. I didn't get much sleep on the trip (although my wife, who is much shorter and smaller had no trouble with sleep). On the return trip (flight 500) the plane was a Boeing 787 with seating 2-2-2 so the seats were a little wider and the seat-to-seat spacing seemed to be better. On that plane the best seats were probably in row 1, since the space for the feet, which didn't have to fit between the seats in front, was much larger. I don't know if that was true of the Airbus 777-200LR, but next time I would definitely opt for row 1.

Jan,2018.0,Stockholm to Cape Town in Business Class,Stockholm,Cape Town Central International Business Class,We travelled with Ethiopian Airlines from Stockholm to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. The flight was reasonably priced and the onboard cabin was great. A modern 787 and 777 interior with fully flat bed on both flights. The transit at Addis Ababa leaves a lot to be desired but was only just over an hour so not too bad. However on the return flight the security claimed we couldn't take a candle onboard which we bought at Cape Town Airport. However the staff member then put the candle on her desk not in the confiscated items pile so I doubt this was the case and I found no law online about candles being prohibited. When I asked to speak to the manager the staff just laughed. Food is not as good as other business class carriers but was better than what would be served in economy class and was acceptable for the reasonable price we paid. If travelling on the 787 I'd aim for a front row seat as the footwell is bigger and more comfortable for sleeping. The other rows have a narrow space for your foot once in bed mode.,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Not to mention Adis Ababa airport which is the most crowded unorganized airport I have ever visited. Regarding the punctuality of the takeoff; we took-off 70 minutes late while we had a transit for exactly the same length in Adis Ababa so we had to run as I ever did before to be able to catch the flight otherwise I will spend the night in Adis Ababa which I can’t as I didn’t have the required vaccinations.

Jan,2018.0,Uneventful Meals,Addis Ababa,Johannesburg Africa Economy,"The food in economy class on this airline is nothing to remember. It is rice, chicken, beef or sometimes fish, bean salad mixed with yellow mustard. Some of the lids on some of the meals were off. When my seat mate asked the airline hostess to give her one with the lid, she was told that meals were put into the food carrier in that manner. Not a good excuse. The dessert is always a cereal bar with dried fruit and the bread is cold and sometimes dry. I do not expect to get the same food that is served to business class customers, but meals should be presented in a way that the shows the airlines cares for all of its customers. I often ask myself who caters the food, because it never changes and the presentation is not nice. Maybe I will begin ordering the other meals that are offered. I never eat the little sandwiches of pressed meat and there are never any sandwiches on board the short flights for vegetarians.

Jan,2018.0,Horrible Experience,Washington DC,Lilongwe International Economy,"So my experience. We fly from Dulles for about an hour, then pilot says we are turning back. Problem with landing gear not retracting. We sit on plane for about an hour then they tell us they will give us a $15 food voucher so we can get our food while we are waiting for them to fix the gear. 3 hours later we are sitting in the airport with no real update, then they announce in Amharic on the 'loudspeaker' (you had to be near the podium to hear anything) that they will give us hotel vouchers for nearby hotels. At this point, we non-amharic speakers are asking for translations from the folks who understand, and it is like playing 'Broken Telephone"". We start following the folks who obviously have a connect at the airline because they always get whispered updates first. 2 hours later we finally all get hotel vouchers then we are told to go outside to go to our hotel. Another 2 hrs and we are battling for shuttles to go to our hotel. Some of the passengers pretty much pay one of the shuttle drivers for another hotel to take us to ours. We are extremely grateful and offer to reimburse them but they refuse. Airline said they would pay for our dinner and breakfast. They neglected to let us know how much we are allowed for dinner so we can't order from the ONLY restaurant that delivers for room service to our hotel (the hotel apparently doesn't have it's own restaurant). The hotel doesn't know what we are allocated, the airline is unreachable. We are now just more than really unhappy. Yelp reviews come to mind. We are told to be at the airport no later than 6am so we get up and go. We get there and the line of people from the day before is winding. The counter finally opens at 7 but they don't start dealing with us until 7:30. Some folks have been standing since 5:30. Some folks at the front of the line are allowing their buddies to cut to the front with over 14 bags of luggage (I counted....I had time).What was more irritating is that the folks at the counter would process them, knowing they had cut the line. Not appropriate at all. Folks get up in arms and people start telling those cutting in line that they are not going to allow it. It was getting heated (phones were coming out to record things). a guy at the counter stands up and tells us that if we are from the plane from the previous day we need to wait ""...over there...."" ***points to a spot way out to his left*** so they can process the people from today's flight. that was when they had to call security because people just started yelling out ""No, we are not moving!"". Eventually they processed us and the people from the current day, but it was not handled well at all. I think, judging from how tired the stewardesses look, they are overworked and the airline is expanding faster than it's customer service can accommodate. Definitely a problem. They used to be really good. I hope they get their act together soon.",3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor
Jan,2018.0,"Some good, some bad",Washington DC,Nairobi International Economy,"It's hard to rate an airline when you are going for a very long flight, because anything even a little negative becomes worse the longer you endure it, and the length is not the airline's fault. I will start by saying there is a nice amount of legroom in economy, though several years ago when I flew this airline we also had foot rests, and I really missed them this trip! I think every flight I've flown on this airline was on a different aircraft. The first leg of this trip, the plane was hot and dry, and my sinuses were a mess for about two days afterwards. The other flights were fine in that regard. The food was fine and plentiful, though they wake you up in the middle of the night to give you a snack, which is ridiculous. I thought airlines were supposed to prepare you for the time zone you are heading to. We were arriving in the early morning and needed sleep. Plus, all the (very many) children had finally just settled in from running up and down the aisles, and then they were awakened again. Not good. Our check-in at Dulles was very long -- and we were some of the lucky ones. By the time we were finished, the line extended from the counter at the back of the terminal all the way around the corner and to the front of the building. We found out later that they hadn't opened soon enough that day, so maybe that's not typically a problem. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. I did tell one of them that the back bathrooms were getting disgusting and she said she would check, though I didn't see later if she had cleaned them up. I think there should be a requirement that bathrooms are cleaned every two hours on flights.

The airport lounge in Addis is okay, but nothing to write home about. I guess they are looking forward to opening of the new terminal later this or early next year.

The food on the plane is about ""normal"" (not very good). Flight attendants were pleasant. But on the return flight, they did not replace the paper products in the bathrooms (this was a 12-hour flight!), so you had to take your own TP! Hmmm. The real ""cultural experience"" is Addis airport. It is truly chaotic. And the announcements for the connecting flights are not very effective - you have to be on alert at all times and keep asking.

Even in economy class I received a travel kit with toothbrush, toothpaste, socks and a really useful eye-mask that actually helped me get to sleep and stay asleep. Food was served twice on the red-eye between BKK and ADD. I declined the first meal to sleep instead, but breakfast was acceptable with juices and hot coffee served. The terminal at ADD is a bit chaotic but was able to find restrooms, then a cafe with reasonably priced food and free wifi between flights. There are no lounges accessible with Priority Pass. Aside from Cloud 9 or Star Alliance lounges there are some open free areas with lounge beds that allow you to fully lie down and rest. Lunch between ADD and JRO, on an A330 this time, was tasty and went down well with red wine. Return flights were about the same in terms of food and flight comfort, and both legs were on the Dreamliner. Excellent IFE on the Dreamliner, plenty of choices of movies, documentaries and TV series. Service on all legs was good but FAs could have brought around liquid refreshments more often to keep us better hydrated.

Disgusting bathrooms that are falling apart and unserviced, no ventilation, no air conditioning, really really bad experience. We were on a shorter lay over on the way in and enthusiastic to get to our final destination so tried to ignore the negatives after a pleasant flight, however, on the return portion we had to accept the absolutely terrible and disgusting experience. We also had difficulty with their security control -- I really dont get how women who are covered head to toe and in mixed company will allow receiving a full pat down in public, doesn't make sense. By the way ladies, I purposely ensure I am not wearing any metals so I can go through the x-ray detector, however the metal on my bra hooks set off this detector, so for that I received the full pat down search in public.

The terminal at Addis is bustling but was able to find a cafe to have a proper meal and rest while waiting for the onward journey that left around 10.30am. Would have enjoyed a stop at the business lounge but there is no access unless you are business passenger (no Priority Pass lounges at ADD). The second flight was smooth and a light meal was served.

Feb,2018.0,"Terrible, just terrible.",Washington DC,Addis Ababa International Economy,"Firstly let me say that both my Wife and I have traveled extensively and experienced many countries and cultures. We traveled air Ethiopia as part of a 2 week inclusive vacation. This is actually 2 reviews in 1 as we traveled from Washington to Addis and then a week later from Addis to the Seychelles Islands. Unfortunately both experiences were the same. The planes were old, dirty and falling apart. On the flight from D.C. there were actually cockroaches in the lavatory. The food on the 12.5 hour flight from D.C. made us both ill so we did not eat another meal even though we spent a total of over 36 hours in the air over the 2 weeks. The airport in Addis is unfortunately, truly, third world. I had to ask for a supervisor to allow us to sit in the gate area while waiting for a connecting flight. You are expected to wait in the ""shopping""area until 1 hour before take off even though there is no where to sit and the bathrooms are built like portables. It is obvious that the airline works their fleet very hard as while waiting we watched 3 planes go through the same gate in 4 hours. The final flight from Addis to D.C. was routed through Dublin Ireland, we landed so the crew could be changed, we sat on the tarmac for an hour, this added 4.5 hours to the flying time for a total of 17 hours. Scheduling the flight to allow for the crew to be changed in the way they did saved the airline from paying their employees, the passengers comfort and experience was obviously not of any concern. Our lesson learned from this experience is to not allow our travel company to choose the ""inclusive"" flights, had we booked our own we would have been better informed and would never have chosen air Ethiopia.

Make sure you have enough water intake before you leave the aircraft in transit no way to buy any water or refreshments.

The flights to Lusaka were on new planes, so the seats were comfortable and there was good amount of legroom, which meant the food tray was a good distance from me, and I was able to sit forward to eat, something I have noted is not the case for every airline. The food is filing and of a reasonable quality, considering the price for the tickets, I didn't expect, but was food provided was not bad. Having said that the menu doesn't vary much, as the flight home was exactly the same. When I used the toilet I have to say it was very dirty, so I told the stewardess, who immediately cleaned it. I have to say Heathrow's assistance staff in general are pleasant and helpful, but the manager I dealt with was rude and obstructive. I received a lecture on how I was late arriving, even though it was obvious I was suffering, as I had difficulty lifting my cases on and off the bus from the car park, and I couldn't find anyone to assist me outside the departures and so had to push a trolley on my own, and so getting into the check-in took me over 45 minutes.

At Addis airport, the priority luggages came out first, but when I took the flight back to Newark, luggages were all mixed up, taking super long time for priority luggages to come out. In flight entertainment needs improvement, in both the range of offerings and the quality of the headphone. Quality of food needs definite improvements compared with other five star airlines (Ethiopia is 4 starts). Also service needs to pay attention to details, so that CAs do not get the order wrong or forget it entirely.

I notified the air hostess and should her my lip, all she did was apologise and ask if i wanted to try a different dish. Of course i refused. As my lip got really bad, i wrote to them to complain.

Feb,2018.0,A top notch international brand that remains a big secret,Yaounde,Washington DC International Economy,"Since it started operating more than seventy years ago as a State-owned corporation. Ethiopian Airlines has consistently gotten better over the years, irrespective of government changes. With little fanfare, it has become a successful International company by simply sticking to the basics: taking air travelers to their destinations safely, comfortably and as economically as possible. The company has new, modern aircraft and an extensive international route that covers virtually all the major inhabited continents. Although it is not well known it surpasses even some of the largest and best known global air carriers in terms of service, safety and price. Its on-time record is impressive , the warmth and professionalism of its youthful staff amazing and endearing , the range of high quality and free onboard services unparalleled and the cleanliness of its cabins and bathrooms refreshing. The one main area the company needs to work even harder to improve is the transit process at its hub at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa. The Airport needs to be expanded and further modernized to serve the company’s passenger growth and destination expansion . While transiting to North American destinations is relatively smooth and comfortable, more needs to be done to improve connections to African destinations . It is especially important to improve the boarding process at the Airport to eliminate the mob rush that occurs when a flight is called. Surely a company that can take hundreds of thousands of passengers safely and on time around the world can control a few hundred passengers trying to board a flight at its home base at Addis Ababa . Overall, Ethiopian Airlines is easily Africa’s best international airline and like Ethiopian and Kenyan long distance runners, an African brand that has consistently improved and prospered globally.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Feb,2018.0,Never again if I have a choice,Cape Town Central,Hong Kong International Economy,"On Saturday, when we checked in at Cape Town International, we have been informed that we might have a problem to be in time for our connecting flight to Hong Kong. However, the lady contacted her manager and between the two of them, they went out of their way to arrange for ET 672 to wait for us in Addis and our luggage were marked with red high priority stickers. Needless to say that neither the flight attendants nor the ground staff attended to us to get to the aircraft ASAP. Instead, we were instructed to go into the airport building and ask for support. My husband approached one of the supervisors who informed us that flight ET 672 left already. We had to go to the transfer desk where we received a hotel voucher and new boarding passes. The service was slow and we confused and disappointed. We managed to get our luggage after waiting for an hour and thirty minutes. During this time my husband read shocking reviews of the given hotel and then decided to book elsewhere. At the hotel, my husband checked the particular flight's whereabouts on a website and realized that the ET 672 only left 15 minutes after our arrival and if the flight attendants were informed and allowed us to leave the aircraft first and if we were supported by ground staff immediately, we were still able to be on ET 672 in time. I am not expecting 5 star service, but we have experienced support on the flight from Hong Kong to Cape Town on 13 February, when we were transported from the aircraft to the other aircraft waiting to depart. It also happened on Sunday evening when passengers from another aircraft embarking from the back door after being transported in a minivan from their aircraft to ours to ensure being in time.

Feb,2018.0,International flight cancelled as a result of mechanical fault of the plane. No communication.,Paris,Durban International Economy,"Sitting in Paris, on our way home to South Africa, two hours after departure time and after passing passport control, waiting to board the plane, we were told that the flight was cancelled because of a mechanical fault on the plane. By this time it was midnight. We were told to take bus to a hotel for the night. No information was forthcoming about when the next flight will be, or what will happen with connecting flights. We tried to make enquiries with the hotel staff, but they referred us to the airline (whom had no representatives nearby, so that did not help). When we got to the hotel we were told to meet in the lobby at 6h30 in the morning. At 6h30 we were told that a bus will collect us at 12h00 to take us to a different hotel. Still no information on the flights. When we got to the other hotel we were told that the replacement flight will be depart at 21h00 that evening and that a bus will collect us at the hotel at 18h00. Still not information on the connecting flights. When we boarded the flight (which is now 24 hours delayed because of the fault on the plain), I asked the ground staff what will happen with the connections, but were told that we will get more information when we land in Addis Ababa. So we had to board on a flight from Paris to Addis Ababa, without knowing what will happen when we will get there. When we got to Addis Ababa we were given boarding passes for the flight to Johannesburg. Our final destination was Durban, so again I enquired what will happen if we get to Johannesburg and were told that we should go to the ground staff in Johannesburg. In Johannesburg we were given boarding passes for the flight to Durban and eventually got there 24 hours after our planned time of arrival. In terms of European Union legislation, should a flight be cancelled as a result of a fault by the airline then they must compensate the passenger with 600 euro. Se we were given a letter from Ethiopian Airlines apologising for the crisis and saying that we can claim the 600 euro from any Ethiopian Airline office. So I went to the Ethiopian Airline office after we got back home and was told that I cannot be helped because the ""supervisor"" is unavailable, but I should leave my details whereafter they will contact me the following business day. This did not happen. So I contacted them again, and was told that the supervisor was still not available and they will get back to me two days later. This again did not happen whereafter I contacted the offices and was told that the supervisor and the person I liaised with were unavailable. This being a week later. Bad food, rude staff and a dirty airport seems rather elementary when you are stuck in a strange country with your wife not knowing how or when you will be going home. And then remaining in limbo for more than a day, without anybody being able to tell you when you are leaving or for how long you will be at that destination. The inconvenience of not being able to attend to responsibilities back home for an uncertain period of time is also a major problem. The make matters worse, the nightmare continues to this day since we were promised compensation, which is simply not forthcoming and we should (like in Paris and Addis Ababa) just wait for something to happen or a ""supervisor"" to bother to communicate with us. We booked the flight because it was the cheapest option and we decided that we can stomach those things most reviews of Ethiopian Airline complains about. We did not expect this nightmare. Next time we will gladly pay more to just simply have an airline we can communicate with.",4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Feb,2018.0,Bad experience due to Ethiopian overbooking practise,Yaounde,Dubai International Economy,"I wish to share my experience with Ethiopian Airlines and the bad experience due to their over booking practice. I took a flight from Yaoundé to Addis ET 925 and from Addis to Dubai with Ethiopian Airlines. The flight from Yaoundé to Addis was not bad. A nice plane and service was ok. When I arrived at Addis, I took my boarding pass to Dubai –ET 612- on Ethiopian and the staff told me that the plane was full and that I was on standby. I was shocked as I had a confirmed ticket and a connection to Mauritius with Emirates. I was told to go to the boarding gates and that needful will be done. The airport at Addis is overcrowded and hectic with insufficient staff that is not well trained to cope with these situations. Arriving at the boarding gate, I met approximately 20 persons who were on standby. When the staff finished the boarding of all other passengers, they decided to take our boarding pass and to board those who were on standby. Unfortunately for us, things were done unprofessionally and with partiality by the staff as we have seen that only Ethiopians who were on standby were able to board. The rest were sent to customer care for a night stay and a rebooking on the next flight. But they could not rebook my connecting flight as I was on emirates. The staff as well the head of the customer assured me that needful will be done and to take the flight to Dubai and to meet the ground staff of Ethiopian there. I took the flight the next day and I arrived at Dubai and did not meet any staff. Fortunately for me, I could get a visa on arrival and I crossed custom and look for Ethiopian office in the building. After 2 hours, I met the head of the Ethiopian’s office and explained my situation to him. He was unaware that I was denied boarding in Addis (despite the guarantee given at Addis by the customer care). They tried to help but could not modify my next booking as it was on another ticket. After many efforts, I was re- booked for the next day flight to Mauritius on Emirates. They were kind enough at Dubai office and they paid the 300 Dirham penalty for rebooking. The conclusion of the story: I have wasted almost 2 days and after dozens of phone calls to return back to normal due to the overbooking practice of Ethiopian. What I deplored in this situation is the lack of professionalism from Ethiopian Airlines. I agree they can do overbooking but at least the customer should be informed in advance and not denied boarding at the gate. A proper communication in advance would have helped to ease the situation and avoid undue stress to the passenger. And I have found that many passengers were denied booking. So be cautious when flying with Ethiopian and not sure that i will consider this airline again.",3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Also, the travellers themselves, as a group, were so quiet, and not demanding, it was an absolute pleasure. We left on time, arrived on time. The airport in Addis Ababa was not so comfortable, but again the flight left on time, and the attendants were courteous and hard-working, dressed beautifully and immaculately. This is Star Alliance, so now we understand that means meeting certain levels of safety and service.

Feb,2018.0,Comfortable pleasant flight with excellent service,Washington DC,Addis Ababa International Business Class,"I have flown international business class on a few different airlines in the past, so I had at least some frame of reference. The organization with whom I was traveling made the reservations and, after reading reviews online, I was a little bit apprehensive. However, I was pleasantly surprised. For the Cloud 9 (business class) service, check-in was rapid, as was boarding. The seats were moderately comfortable when in the upright position, but better when slightly or fully reclined (they did recline to full flat for sleeping). The entertainment system used the older ""two-prong"" connector so if you do not have an adapter for more contemporary single prong input, you can either opt for mono instead of stereo sound, or you can use their bulky somewhat uncomfortable headsets. The entertainment monitor is a reasonable distance from your seat but big enough that is is fine. The movie selection was not exactly the latest and greatest but you will certainly find a few movies of interest. One thing I will have to say is that the food service was plentiful. Quality was reasonable, not great, but the variety was good. The service was excellent. The flight attendants were very accommodating and pleasant, as good or better than most airlines I have been on. I did find the temperature a bit warm on the flight.

Feb,2018.0,Good value if very low risk of needing customer service support,Harare,Gonder Africa Economy,"I have two experiences with Ethiopian airlines in the last few years -both led to loss of the whole ticket costs. They certainly offer good prices but if there is a risk of needing to change your plans in any way, you can write off being able to do so with Ethiopian airlines. The ticket will be lost and you will need highly comprehensive travel insurance to have a hope of recovering any of it. Having flown a great deal to and from Africa from the UK over the years unfortunately both these experiences were by chance unique in that I happened to need customer support help from ethiopian airlines which I have not needed with other airlines. Both experiences were to make changes to the ticket- once a slight error to my name on the ticket, the other time was to change a ticket travel destination and time. Both times Ethiopian airlines customer service were close to pointless in contacting on multiple levels. Little interest in helping either by phone or in person, by phone- poor phone sound quality even calling the office in the UK, incredibly variable inconsistent advice depending on which day I rang or to whom I spoke. The cost of making any destination or time alterations will be equivalent to a new ticket if they have been booked for their lower cost. In order to change our route from Harare to Gondar via Addis(10 hrs) to Harare to Windhoek via Addis (similar time) that cost similar prices online we were only offered a 5 day journey from Harare to Lilongwe to Blantyre to Johannesburg to Windhoek for an additional £300-400 person. The part of this that was the Alteration fee- this changed almost daily despite advice to the contrary but settled on £180 and £280 for me and my wife. Then the rest was ‘airfare difference’ I would still use Ethiopian but only on flights with a very low risk of needing customer services.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Feb,2018.0,Uncomfortable night flight,Johannesburg,Abuja Africa Economy,The flight from Johannesburg to Addis was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I have had in a long time. The seats were hard and narrow and there was no inflight entertainment for the long hours awake. It was a midnight flight and I just needed to sleep. It was impossible. Then to my surprise the flight to Abuja was in a comfy airbus with excellent inflight entertainment. I wished it was the other way round since the first leg was the longer one.

Mar,2018.0,seats must have been 17 years old,Mekele,Dakar,"Mekele to Dakar via Addis Ababa. The short flight from Mekele to Addis Ababa was on B737 with good regional business class but very low quality snack was served. On arrival all business class passengers got into minivan, only I was told to take economy class bus as minivan is only for VIP passengers. Older business class lounge in Addis Ababa but fine for 2 hours and with quite good breakfast selection. When I did web checking I noticed that originaly scheduled B787 was switched to B767. I was not alarmed as all Boeing 767 were supposed to be refurbished with lie flat beds. So I was shocked when I boarded to see recliner seats which must have been 17 years old. The seat would be ok for short regional flight but not for 10 hours I spent on the plane (there was technical stop in Bamako). On seat under the pillow and blanket there was left lots of rubbish from previous flights. Only overhead monitors were available and these were so low quality and dark that it was impossible to watch anything. Crew was just OK. They did what they were supposed to do but not very friendly. Food was edible, with the exception of Ethiopian dish which was excellent (you get both western and Ethiopian dish) and it is good that they serve it from trolley, otherwise I would have difficulties to know what to choose. In future if I could be guaranteed that flight would be operated with A350 or B787 and ticket price would be good, I wouldn’t have problem flying Ethiopian again. But knowing that the planes can be switched to this kind of inferior product, I would not fly again with them. When I was leaving Dakar (fortunately on other airline) there was Ethiopian Boeing 737 at airport. I am not sure if it was originally scheduled airplane or there was aircraft change, but this B737 would be even worse for length of this flight than the B767.",2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,AirlineQuality

So a good option if you really just want to sleep and do not care about all of the ‘extras’. However on a recent flight the the stewardesses continued to serve alcohol to a gentleman until the point that he felt it was okay to physically grab me on my way to the toilet. When I reported this to cabin crew and told them I wanted to move they were less than helpful and initially tried to have me stay next to this guy telling me ‘nothing will happen. We are always awake’. Well something had already happened in part because they continued to supply this guy with alcohol despite the fact that he was basically talking loudly to himself ... I honestly did not worry about being assaulted but still was not comfortable being near this guy and trying to fall asleep. Only when another (male) passenger also insisted that they move me and even offered his seat did it seem to get them to realize that they should move me to an empty seat in another part of the cabin.

Mar,2018.0,Long haul-Short haul,Toronto,Kigali International Business Class,"The flight from Toronto was fantastic; business class on Boeing Dreamliner. Excellent attention from the flight attendants including one dressed in traditional Abyssinian garb. Be careful about the food; there will be a lot of it. Besides the usual snacks, around dinner time the FA arrives with a cart of Ethiopian food. 2 types of injera and 5 entrees. Memory is beef, chicken, goat, a vegetable and one more. I chose 3 and most were delicious except the vegetable which I think was kale. After the Ethiopian meal the FA arrived with the dinner entree. Too much. I was already sated. I did have the salad and the dessert. There is a good selection of European and American wine along with a local Rift Valley red and a chardonnay. There were 2 negatives to the 13 hour flight. It departs around noon Eastern time so it is difficult to sleep until the last few hours. The full flat bed felt slightly short for me at 5' 11"" and the space for your feet is quite narrow. The pillow and duvet are high quality. This may be true of many Dreamliners or may just be Ethiopian's design. The selection of entertainment is vast and varied. The reading light does not provide enough illumination for reading. Addis Ababa is not a fun airport. Lots of small duty free stores mostly specializing in cigarettes. The business class lounges are divided by mileage and I was in the lowest tier.There is also a Gold and a Platinum lounge. The breakfast food wasn't very good but I had coffee, fruit and pastry. My next leg departed at 2 and by 10 AM I was alone in the lounge except for the cleaning staff. I kept changing my seat to stay out of their way as they vacuumed and mopped :-) The second 2 hour leg to Kigali was on an older and shabby 757. Even in business the seat pockets were torn. But, again, the service was excellent. The FA was rushed to serve a snack that was immediately followed by a lunch (I chose Ethiopian because most flights in to Kigali are on older equipment. This route would provide me the greatest length on the better plane and the shortest on the older model.) Although my baggage was tagged priority they were among the last to be delivered. Probably due to the extended layover in Addis they were loaded first and therefore off last. Immigration at Kigali has significantly improved and now visas can be obtained on arrival. There is also an East African visa that allows travel in Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya on a single (more expensive) visa in case you plan to see more of the continent. The return trip was pretty much a copy of the first. Boarding in Kigali is by bus and there is a dedicated bus for business class. Boarding in Addis is a bit more annoying. All passengers go through additional screening before boarding. There is no separate line for business class, so there is a bit of delay. Then once you are through security, business and first have a small area of seats while economy stands in line. I was a bit embarrassed to have the extra privilege quite so publicly on view I chose more wisely on the dining menu for the flight home; sampling but not over doing it. The flight was more attuned to body sleep time and we landed in Toronto at about 8 AM feeling refreshed. I easily drove the 2 hours home to the states.

Mar,2018.0,Beware! Airlines will randomly change your flight,Lalibela,Johannesburg Africa Economy,"I booked Ethiopian airlines to fly from Kigali - Lalibela (with a transfer in Addis Ababa). The airlines changed the flight’s departure a day before but since the flight was changed to an earlier departure, it did not impact my connecting flight. On my incoming flight back, the airlines changed the flight from Lalibela direct to Addis Ababa to Lalibela- Gondar-Addis Ababa. Instead of having more than 2 more hours for my connection to fly internationally to Johannesburg, I now only have 45mins (assuming the flight departs on time) to catch my connecting flight. It takes a while at immigration and there are lots of security checks so 45 mins is very tight. Plus it’s the Easter holidays. I don’t understand how can Ethiopian airlines just change their flights to include an additional stopover a few days before the actual departure without any reason. Customer service was bad and provided no help and simply said 45mins is enough. Well, I know I’m never gonna take Ethiopian airlines again and I just want to warn others that they will just randomly change your flight and it is a high chance.

Mar,2018.0,Unprofessional Service from Ethiopian Airlines,Addis Ababa,Entebbe Africa Economy,"I flew ET0332 today from Addis Ababa to Entebbe. When I booked and bought my flight the departure time showed 8:20am and arrival at 10:25am at Entebbe. I go to the airport to check in 2 hours in advance and was told the flight is over booked and had to stand at the counter for 1 hour, even if the staff at the counter offered little help to solve the problem they were polite. After an hour of back and forth I was able to check it, only to found out that the Flight to Entebbe never departs at 8:20am rather at 10:00am. The attitude of the staff then became deal with it your mistake. I show them my ticket and the time no one bothered to explain or seem to understand how such unprofessional incident happened. I decided to go to customer care booth to explain to them this is unprofessional, I obviously knew I wasn't going to change the flight hours because my flight time stated the wrong time. But my greatest disappointment came while the person seating behind the desk was rude and never said the word sorry for the inconvenience we caused you, rather she went on to say: ""You can go online and submit your complains or wait for my supervisor who should be hear in an hour or so and speak to him."" Some of the staff of ET go above and beyond to help people but they also have staffs that are quite unfit for hospitality. Flying ET, I usually hear the staff saying unprofessional thing about customers in the local language when they know they are international and can't speak the language. I also see them being more aggressive towards other African Nationalities including Ethiopians, this is my personal opinion based my experience flying ET for over 5 years. That to me is very unprofessional and offending, even if people don't understand what staffs of ET are saying about the client to each other, I believe people feel bad. For me looking at that makes feel as if they are misrepresenting our nation.

Mar,2018.0,Endless delays compounded by poor customer skills by Ethiopian Airlines employees,Addis Ababa,London International Economy,"This was a horrendous experience made considerably worse by the terrible customer relationship skills of the Ethiopian Airlines employees. About 1:00 am on 3 March 2018, we boarded the flight to Heathrow. After about 30 minutes we were advised that the flight would be delayed for 30 minutes due to a “software problem”. About a half hour later we were told that the flight would be delayed for another hour. About 30 minutes after that, we were instructed to get off the plane and wait in the departure area. While there, we were repeatedly advised that there would be a further 30 minute delay (or sometimes a further one hour delay). We ultimately left about five hours late. What made this particularly bad was the inexperience/lack of training of the Ethiopian Airlines staff, as follows: 1. We never once were told what the problem was, or how long we’d be delayed. There seemed to be no comprehension on the part of the staff that, after repeatedly being told that there’d by another 30 minute delay, on one would believe that estimate. Ethiopian employees need to learn that there are numbers larger than one. 2. While an endless supply of muffins was provided in large bins, only one drinking water dispenser was provided. It was constantly running out of water. 3. While the departure area did have washroom facilities, they were outside the checkpoint for boarding passes. (They were though, inside the security checkpoint.) One Ethiopian Airlines employee attempted to control the checkpoint by taking boarding passes from whoever wanted to use the washroom. When you returned, she then had to flip through a huge stack of boarding passes to find yours. The risk of not getting your boarding pass back increased the level of stress. Note: After doing this for a couple of hours, she finally stopped and disappeared, allowing us to use the washroom without having to show any ID. 4. In addition to the employee in (3), after about three or four hours all other Ethiopian Airlines employees except one disappeared. The one employee who was left was clearly overwhelmed and had no idea how to handle the situation. Of note: (a) He only apologized for the situation once (and that was after a lot of passengers told him he better start doing so). (b) He clearly was unable to understand that continuously announcing 30 minute delays every half hour was not really providing the passengers with the information they wanted and would only add to the aggravation. Note: When we finally got back on the plane, every announcement included an apology. As for the flight itself, it was the “usual” Ethiopian service – good but not outstanding. As per my comments on a previous Ethiopian flight, Ethiopian needs to spend a few more birr (dollars) on its entertainment system. The “blockbuster” movies are anything but, and a disappointment for those of us who don’t sleep on planes.",1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Also, there was no tea or coffee on offer, I think it was simply forgotten. On my second leg (Addis Ababa-London) it was rice with some dry lentils and some spinach. Not very appetising at all.

To be honest I was a bit suspicious about the company, but after being very well cared in the company private lounge and all my belongings taken care, and boarding the brand new Boeing Dreamliner in Douala I felt very relaxed, the front cabin is extremely comfortable, the champagne and food, including some exotic Ethiopian delicacies was superb, music selection had a refreshing approach to world music, arrival in Adis Ababa, hotel transfers to and back airport where very good also.

Apr,2018.0,Horrible experience,Cape Town Central,Stockholm International Economy,"I didnt want to write a review of this flight but I just cant help it. I flew with ethiopian before, never complained, got decently good food and okay service. But on my return flight from cape town to stockholm we had a between landing in Ethiopia and let me tell you, it wasnt good. I dont want to talk badly on the airline by dissing the airport but since it is their main hub and base it is their responsibility. When we landed after our 6 and a half hour flight we were directed towards the terminal. We ended up outside of security again even though it was only around 2 hours untill our next flight but we didnt mind that. Not untill we got to go through security which asked every person to put off their shoes.Also they let the girl in front of us (who was ethiopian) let go through with a manicure scissors? And then when we thought we were done as well this worker reaches into our small see through plastic bag and takes lighter which my partner colects (and is approved to have all over the world and never had problem before, obviously had it on the last flight as well) and doesnt say a word. I try to ask him what he is doing taking things without letting us know and he just shushed us away leaving us very disstressed. After finding our gate which we werent actually sure because the signs werent clear, our flight was late, we didnt know how long. We sat in this big room full of people, it was warm, it looked dirty and it smelled very badly in there. I would compare it to a big barn and expected to see some goats go by soon. When we were going to finally board the bus to get to our plane, without any reason my partner got her ticket changed and was sat somewhere completely different without explanation even when the seats were pre booked. We trued to talk to them bu again were ignored and sent away and for 7 and a half hour flight we did wanted to sit together. Thankfully the flight wasnt full and we got to sit together anyway. After all of this, we were happy sitting in a new boeing 787, sattisfied we will finally get home after this horrible travel day but, when we got home we both apparently got food poisoning so, not so good after all and ended up staying home another 3 days from work. I dont know why this last leg of our journey was so bad but i got so dissapointed i am very sure we wont be travelling with ethiopian and definitely not to ethiopia itself anytime soon.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

The child was quiet, the mother attentive. But the attendant brought out a crib that attached to the bulkhead, effectively cutting off any chance for me to move until and unless she did.

At one point, i experienced some bad pain in my stomach and sought the assistance of the attendants but for sometime they did not know what to do which was really bad for me because i was in serious pain. They even left me alone at some point and i felt very helpless. Eventually, after an agonizing period, one of the senior attendants gave me something to drink which eased the pain and was able to endure the rest of the flight. The transfer experience at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa was not pleasant. The ground officer who was directing us where to go was not very nice and when i tried to asked him about my luggage he quickly shrugged me off, telling me to move fast. And the worst happened, because when i got to Nairobi my luggage was missing and had to wait a day to get it back. There were other passengers on the same flight who experienced the same problem. The loss of my luggage took away the little good experience i had, had with this flight. I cannot say i will not fly Ethiopian Airlines again because i have flown with them before and my experience the last time was good. I believe this was just one of those days.

Apr,2018.0,Competitive pricing,Entebbe,Zanzibar Island Africa Economy,"Considering that this is a really long way round to get from Entebbe to Zanzibar, the price was better than flying a more direct route. It made the journey longer, but the dates of their schedule fitted better with our plans. We endured a 6hr layover in Addis mainly because we knew it would be rough from past experience and were mentally prepared for it. ET are building a wonderful new terminal and one day it will be great. Right now the OK terminal is not OK anymore. This is especially true if there are a lot of people in transit in which case there can be literally nowhere to sit. There are no pay lounges. There were in the past and you will find hints and tips on how to find them, but they are not there now. African chaos ensues as everyone has to line up for security even though you just got off a plane. This can take an hour during which time you slowly snake along trying to stop impatient travellers from pushing past you. Once through you find yourself in the dreariest waiting area you are ever likely to encounter. If you try to go through security early in the hope of finding a seat you are like to be sent away and not allowed to queue up. During the dreaded queuing people who have been sufficiently delayed by the chaotic system will be pulled out and fast tracked past the queue. I think it's worth knowing this if ET is going to be a good option for you otherwise so you won't be too disappointed by the big sign saying 'welcome to the home of hospitality' when there is no evidence of hospitality anywhere! It's quite often not so bad as I describe, depending on what gate you are using and how many people are in the terminal. I arrived late for a connection. on one occasion and was whisked directly to the plane. They have some new planes and I find their service comparable to most others. I normally like the food.

The only problem I have with them, is that they tend to miss handle your luggage. To their credit I must admit that they replaced the damage suitcases a couple of times, except for once, when according to them, I did not follow the right procedures! I landed in Delhi from Cape Town in April 2017, after a long flight and discovered outside the terminal that the one wheel of my suitcase was basically broken off! I decided to rather go to my hotel and then report the damage back in Cape Town. At home I was informed by their staff that I should have reported it in Delhi. I phoned them and sent a couple of mails, to no avail! I then liaised with their airport manager, who promised me that he agree with me and will see that I get another suitcase, but after about four months, he told me that it can't be done! I think their integrity went for a blank with this ordeal and would like to urge fellow travelers to report damages immediately, don't wait and do it at a later stage, even if you are tired after a long flight.",2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

I was impressed. I flew to and returned from London via Addis Ababa and all the flights were great. The business class cabin and the service is easily comparable with airlines like British Airways, SAA and Lufthansa with lie flat seats allowing a comfortable sleep. On the way to London I had a four hour stopover in Addis which I wouldn't recommend; the airport is dismal and the lounge is adequate and comfortable if a little basic. On the return I had a two hour stopover which was OK. The stopover when flying this route can pose a problem in getting a good night's sleep because each flying leg is 7/8 hours; not much sleeping time with a meal being served after take-off and another two hours before landing. I enjoyed a meal and a few movies on one leg and slept from take-off to landing on the other (with the help of a sleeping pill).

Apr,2018.0,Worst flying experience EVER!,Addis Ababa,Washington DC International Economy,"I was traveling home to the United States after a safari vacation in Tanzania and was already not excited about the 17-hour flight, which turned out to be the worst experience I've ever had on an airplane. It was like being in a cattle car. There was chaos during the boarding process as people fought for overhead space for their bags. There were small babies on the flight who screamed and cried the entire time while the parents and flight attendants seemed oblivious to the noise. I had finally fallen asleep around midnight when the cabin lights were lit to serve a meal. Who the hell needs to eat at midnight?! I got no sleep on the 17-hour flight, even after pleading with the flight attendants to do something about the crying babies (who the parents just ignored). The seats were incredibly cramped. And ... the cherry on top ... I am covered in bug bites, which I'm sure happened on the plane. The plane was filthy, including the bathroom.

Apr,2018.0,Not flying with Ethiopian airline again!,London,Harare International Economy,"Travelling from London Heathrow to Harare via Addis Ababa with 3 adults, a child 7 years and a toddler 14 months. Addis Ababa airport very old and quite dirty, not enough seating considering it’s one of the main points for transferring passengers to the rest of world. A lot of the same shops not a good variety or choices. Not a lot of food shops, a lot of souvenir shops and very expensive too. Plane service from staff very bad, I don’t know if it’s a culture thing but some staff no thank you or please. They tell you how it is, it’s like they had no customer service training what so ever. One even rolled her eyes at me! When I ask them for water or if they have food for my tod (of course I had some,but I did request when booking flight), they say I will check and never come back to me with an answer. Some is just a straight no with a weird look (as if I’m asking them for the moon) without even checking. Flight attendants talk across the aisles and passing food and drinks to each other, over passengers heads. Very unprofessional and disorganised. The same with Indian airline. Overall you can tell the staff are tired and fed up. They’re not doing it with their hearts. What they say, how they’ve said it and body language is all key to your audience. Food choices and quality was poor, I know being in economy doesn’t help but I’ve seen and tasted better in other economy class. When they run out of one option they say to me beef? Instead of apologising for running out of options and offering me beef. What if I had said no, then I will starve? Entertainment wasn’t bad. Seating was quite spacious (comparing to Virgin Atlantic 12 hours direct flight). Plane from London to Addis Ababa was quite new so if felt clean. Addis Ababa onwards plane condition quite old and tattered so it felt clammy and sticky. Ethiopian airline have been promoting their app, yet it does not work! Can’t check in or select seats!

My first flight was from Sao Paulo, Brazil to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia which took me 12 hours. The flight attendances were very nice and I thought interesting that once they pass by someone who was asleep, they kindly wake the person up once food service was been served. That was nice since many people miss the food because they fall asleep during the flight. Also, they pass by you many times with more drinks and food, offering as much as you want, so you don't need to be asking. There were nice big scream tv in each and every seat with a big variety of movies, music, games and a cel phone charger.

Only concern is that the interior of the fleet was rather simple seating and inconsistent. The dreamliner on my return was older and the seat did not recline all the way. The A350 was newer and seating more comfortable, however an endless ping/beeping through the whole trip. on my asking the head steward, he told me it was the call button in economy that is very close to the passenger and they keep bumping it. i cannot believe that this is the only airline with A350's with this problem and rather a poor excuse. Most irritating if you want peace and quiet with the constant ping. Put on your earphones and try to forget.

Apr,2018.0,One point for new aircraft - another for no major delays,Frankfurt,Harare International Economy,"On a recent trip from Europe to Zimbabwe and Zambia I had 6 flights with Ethiopian. Four with new Airbus A350 and two with Boeing 777. All six aircrafts were filthy. Seats had stains, baggage compartments had on 5 aircraft black greasy stains, on two aircraft the seat was broken and on all flights the carpet was dirty. On two flights the IFE was not working at all and on one the touch screen did not react. I just hope their essential maintenance processes are not as sloppy as keeping the interior clean and in working order. Even the relatively new A350 planes’ interiors were in appalling condition. There is no WiFi on any of the planes despite many airlines start to have this as a standard feature when they renew their fleet. A350s’ did not have the tail and underbelly camera which other airlines have in their A350s. Ethiopian also changed the scheduled departure times several flights without notifying the passengers until one day before. The service on long-haul flights was extremely slow. When leaving from Frankfurt they brought the food only after three hours of flying by which time the flight was already half way to Addis Ababa. It was at 4 am when they came to collect the trays away - when there was just 1,5 hours to landing. Addis Ababa airport is chaotic. Even “the new” terminal building is far too small for the amount of people - seat are too few and when it rains the roof leaks. The ‘duty free’ sells fake perfumes. If one needs to wait longer time between flights the restaurants - or rather bars - are appalling. There is supposed to be WiFi at Bole Airport which of course doesn’t work and no one bothers to fix it. In the future, I try to avoid Ethiopian.

May,2018.0,8 Hours on the phone,Lome,Newark,"The actual experience of flying with Ethiopian is OK. Nothing special, not really on par with the transatlantic coach flights to and from Europe, but pretty standard quality of food and service that I have come to expect from flights to and from Africa. However, a colleague had a medical emergency so I had to extend my trip, which meant I had to rebook my returning ticket. I cannot express to you the horror of that experience. Despite the fact that I was more than willing to pay whatever necessary change fees and rate differences, it took me a total of 8 Hours on the phone with them to rebook. They do not allow rebooking online, which meant that I had to spend an entire day on hold with various people, which is not easy (or Cheap) from a remote part of Ghana with little cell service. Every time I would get through the hold line and speak with a representative, they would figure out a flight for me, then ""transfer"" me to their sales department, and I would be hung up on. Or I would be on hold for an hour Then hung up on. After the complete mess that was finally getting this sorted out was finished, After 8 hours of this nonsense, they tell me that I cannot be confirmed for the rebook yet because I had to pay the change fees first, In Person In Cash. What airline in 2018 doesn't accept online payments, card payments over the phone, or even wired money? Of course, I was in rural Ghana, which meant I couldn't spend 3 days traveling from there to their head office in the capital to pay this change fee when the entire point was that I was unable to travel to Accra at that time for my original flight. After 2 weeks of fighting with them over the phone about this, Finally one of the local agents tells me I can pay the money into their bank account in a city nearby my location (who knows Why no one ever gave me that option previously!?). I was very worried this would turn out to be a scam because it was a pretty sketchy set up, but it worked out in the end. Moral of the story; if you can avoid booking with Ethiopian Airlines, Do It, because it you have any problems at all you are out of luck.",2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,AirlineQuality
May,2018.0,FAs excellent and attentive,Addis Ababa,Stockholm,"Addis Ababa to Stockholm. Flights to Cape Town from Stockholm are thin on the ground. You can either choose the major European carriers such as BA, KLM's daylight service or AF (all of which are about €800) or use Emirates or Qatar and make do with the long flights through the Middles East. I decided to use Ethiopian Airlines which was the most cost effective and fastest service (< 2 hours connection times in both directions) Although 3 out of 4 legs were in economy, I'm going to review the business class service which I won through a reverse auction. As a self employed person, the only other 787 business I have flown is Qatar Airways 1-2-1 product. Ethiopian uses a 2-2-2. This means that there is a distinct advantage of taking one of the center seats where both you and your neighbor have direct aisle access. That being said, I really didn't notice the smaller seat width as the proof of the pudding is in the sweat pitch. FAs were excellent and attentive (as good as the Middle East airlines). Food seemed good (though not brilliant) as I took a night flight and just had water and tea. IFE was excellent in terms of screen size and choices. Bed was almost flat but long enough to sleep for most of the flight. Only downside was having one toilet for the whole cabin compared to Qatar which has two for only 20 seats. Lastly, for all the bad press that Bole airport has, whilst it wasn't a dream, it was no worse than I've been to in other parts of Europe for sheer chaos. I wouldn't like to spend 8 hours there. The most worrying aspect was the runway setup which meant that both landing and departing aircraft had to taxi across the runway to get to the gates or line up for take off. A little investment at the East and West entry points could solve this relatively easy.",4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,AirlineQuality

Flight of 5 hrs plus and no in flight entertainment-drop down screens did not work. Addis Ababa to Lilongwe leg-passenger became ill on route - a medical emergency due to diabetic seizure. Luckily two doctors on board, and the female doctor and the cabin crew administered a drip and patient recovered. Full praise to the doctor and cabin crew who had the necessary first aid kit and were calm and efficient throughout. We were not diverted. Eventually arrived in Blantyre on time - you are not allowed off the aircraft at Lilongwe if in transit. Return leg- Blantyre to Addis Ababa Boeing 737-800 - this was a newer cleaner aircraft. Meal was served which was reasonable but the passenger behind me had a beef stew which was cold and had to be replaced. Addis to London an A350- a newer aircraft, comfortable seats. Configuration a little strange - very large galley area and a large space near emergency doors at rear of the aircraft. I hope they leave this space as it is and not add extra seats. Flight was over 7 hours and they served a snack instead of an evening meal - a dry ""chicken roll"" which has nearly no filling and was very poor followed by a cereal bar. Before landing there was a ""breakfast"" which was egg, potato and a synthetic thing called a sausage. This was probably the worst breakfast I have tried to eat in many years of flying and I had to leave most of it. Plane was on time. Cabin crew were without charm but were efficient.

May,2018.0,Be warned. Little did we know how much of a flightmare it would be.,New Delhi,Addis Ababa International Economy,"This may take a couple of minutes of your time, but I guarantee that it will make you reconsider the airline. To start off our trip-timeline, we flew in to Delhi on the 11th of May, around 2100 hours with a domestic airline. Our flight from Delhi to Addis Ababa was set to be on the 12th of May at 0230 hours. We were flying with Ethiopian. Lo and behold, the horror begins. So we wait till 12:30 for Ethiopian’s check-in counter to open. While waiting in line, we notice the departure time for our aircraft, ET687, to be a little shifty. It didn’t say 02:30 on the screen. It said 05:30. An additional three hours of wait. We checked-in three bags, and two bags as carry-ons; went through security and started settling in to push those three hours till boarding. Dozed off in between and woke up only to find out that the departure time had been pushed again, by another two hours. A delay of an unaccountable nature. I’m sure you can understand the level of our frustration at this point. We boarded, finally. But then the bigger problem was that we missed our connecting flight to Nosy-Be, a tiny island in Madagascar, that already had only a handful of flights coming in every week. When we finally got to Addis Ababa, we were made to wait in lines at the transfer desk where the lady who worked for the airline, with quite an unpleasant demeanour, gave us alternate boarding passes to another aircraft flying out that night, rerouting us through Johannesburg. It was either that or waiting a day more to catch a direct flight to Nosy-Be. Our worry now was if whether the bags that we checked-in would travel with us to Johannesburg. Because the baggage tags had an entirely different connecting route on them. And we knew there would be a high chance of a mix-up or confusion. So we enquired to the mean lady, stressing on the part about our bags travelling with us on the alternate flight that she put us on. She assured us it will when we kept asking again and again. All the transfers who had a later flight that day were put in hotels. It’s funny how all the Europeans/European-Americans were put in rather good hotels and all the Indians put in one hotel, and a rather questionable hotel at that. And this, quite disturbed us. If we were travelling by, say, Emirates/Etihad, this would, not happen first of all, but second of all, if at all it did, they would be compensating our every second lost during this inconvenience. But not a shade of that basic courtesy came from this filth of an airline. Imagine our dilemma. I forgot to mention that this was our honeymoon. Preposterous, to say the least, I hope. And as if they hadn’t caused us enough trouble already, our flight back home from Addis Ababa was also delayed by a few hours because of an unexpected stopover to check the engines. Which only affirmed our impression of how ill-maintained the aircrafts were. Our flight from Delhi to Cochin, if we had reached on time, was after four hours. But now the wait was only two hours because of the delay. But we land in Delhi and transfer to check-in for that flight only to find out that our tickets were cancelled, by none other than the great Ethiopian Airlines. Surely you can imagine the ruckus that we would’ve caused. And surely enough they had no choice but to put us on a later flight that day. Utter disgust for the airline at point. Not once, not twice, but consistently causing us an inconvenience, the entire round trip, beginning till end. Severely under-compensating our every reasonable request, the airline and the people who work for it, were quite irresponsive and irresponsible in person and especially over the phone. The overall discipline enforced by the airline associates at the counters, and at the gates, where passengers queue-up to check-in or board, is unforgivably lax. It was total chaos. And never have we seen such a haphazard service by any airline, and not to mention an international one. My husband and I express our deepest disdain for the airline in the most animated language. Never, I repeat, NEVER in your lifetime travel with this shame of an airline, if you can help it. You will be doing yourself a kindness.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,TripAdvisor

May,2018.0,Flight to Killimanjaro via Addis Ababa,Mumbai,Kilimanjaro National Park International Economy,"We availed this flight to travel from Mumbai to Tanzania. Unfortunately this is not a very professional airline. Since we made our booking the airline changed their departure schedule 3 times. Luckily we were on their connecting flight from Addis Ababa onwards, but imagine the plight of other passengers who have connecting flight on other airlines to different destinations. The planes are comparatively new and so comfortable. But there was a big issue with blankets and pillows. One had to literally run after the air hostess to get one. Quite a few went without it. After a sleepless night at the airport we left at 4.00 hrs IST(on time) . Everyone quickly tried to get a wink of sleep. But the airline continued to keep the lights on and god knows after how much time started serving the meal. I did not have any as it was no time to have a meal. Before we landed at Addis Ababa at 7.00 hrs local time, I asked for a cup of tea. I was told that there was no service. After landing at Addis Ababa airport we had three hours to connect our next flight. Experience at the airport was terrible. There was no place to sit. People were sleeping using more than one seat. People were sprawled all over the floor and the toilets were packed and dirty. Even crossing from one terminal to the other was a nightmare. We found no water to drink.

I was traveling to South Africa Johannesburg and since i was flying Ethiopian Airlines i had to pass through Ethiopia to my destination. First the Flight was kinda overbooked and very very old so i was among the last passengers to board and when i got in,my seat was taken. And halfway the flight at the back was all men (2 football teams) Got too scared and a flight attendant just told me to seat wherever i could see a seat. Which i did. A few minutes later a passenger came and claimed the seat and i had to stand. Anyway, finally got a seat but it was so uncomfortable. The food to me was just pathetic so i preferred fasting for once. The guy seated next to me was so disgusted that he opted to join me in fasting. The Second flight from Ethiopia to Johannesburg was the best. Spacious and more comfortable. Wasn't too crowded and the meal was just perfect. Had a wide selection of movies too and the flight attendants were more friendly, well groomed and looked relaxed. I would rate the first flight 2/10 and the second flight 10/10. Mind you all were Ethiopian but with different experiences. As i flew back home i was shocked to learn that i wasn't flying Ethiopian but Malawian. Most uncomfortable flight ever. (I hear Ethiopian have shares in malawian airlines so they mix passengers.

I wanted to book a flight to Ethiopia for this summer, and the process this year, I found was very frustrating. At first, they made changes to their website... but I found it to be not customer friendly in many ways! At the end, it would not accept my booking with no clear explanation. I made multiple phone calls using the 1-800 number and I had to wait more than 15 minutes several times to talk to some one. One of the ladies I talked to was very friendly but could not address my problem properly. The other person, dropped my call after I explained to her what the problem was. On many occasions, the 1-800 number tells me to wait 2 minutes and then it automatically reverts into the message saying they are too busy now and it drops my call repeatedly. I called the local number for Washington DC, and after repeated attempts I was able to talk to some one. All in all this is not the service one should expect from an airlines who is the leader in Africa. They should know that customers in the US and Europe (for that matter from everywhere) expect good customer service and EAL should make it a priority to have a customer friendly website, as well as adequate number of customer service agents who are knowledgeable and friendly.

May,2018.0,Worst Experience,Abuja,Dubai International Economy,"My travel from Abuja Nigeria with Ethiopian airline dated 12th May 2018(ET910 seat 25D) is the worst ever experience... A flight from Abuja was delayed for 5 hours and none of the airline team has told us what was the reason.. when we arrived in Addis Ababa, majority of the passenger that has connecting journey missed their flight. The worst thing, there are only 3 ground staff whom none of them knew what to do.. no instruction is given, all fury passenger to get their queries are being ignored... waited for more than 2 hours in the airport and finally the ground staff decided to send us to the hotel.. i/we (atleast 30 passenget) have been given to stay in a hotel called Jupiter and when we arrived in the hotel they cant check us in, we spent 45 minutes waiting for the hotel staff if they can accomodate us but they cant give any information.. some of us decided to go back to the airport as it became very frustrated standing in the hotel reception with no clue on what is going on... we were dropped in the airport by the hotel bus and we have been assisted by one immigration staff to go back to departure area... when we go back to arrival and transfer office and shared our experience, the ground crew almost ignore our situation and asking us ""What to do"" and commented no compensation at all in rudely manner.. a pathetic gentlemen who doesnt have a customer service at all.. A very frustrating situation to all the passenger and it was unbelievable that the crew is almost saying shut up to those passenger that are raising concern... Please see mote of my frustration.. 1. Upon arrival in Addis Ababa, none of the ground staff assited or directed any passenger.. we need to chase 2 or 3 of them to give us answer to all our query. 2. No Manager or atleast responsible staff to answer us on all our queries... 3. Staff are keep on telling us to check to one staff to another staff.. 4. Hotel was booked for the passenger without checking if there is available room..some of the passnger been to 3 hotel nut were refused as apparently no room is available. 5. Passenger are complaiming but the staff in the arrival and transfer office is holding his chin and nodding with sarcasm without any response to us. 6. Some passenger ask for atleast a snack in the airport but refused by the airline staff and keep ignoring the passenger.. 7. Waiting time in the arrival is almost 2 hours before we can get response, waiting to get a bus is 30 minutes the worst thing is we dont know where is the bus us no one is assiting is..waiting for the hotel staff to tell us going on is atlwast 30 minutes tilm we decided to go back to the airport... 8. Your ground team are very unprofessional with no clue at all on what customer service is.. Ethiopian Airline management, i have chosen for the second time your airline expecting a good service or someone that has customer service... i have felt that my rights and passengers rights are being taken away.. please be fair with your passenger, i will never ever use your airline again and i will do everything i could not to recommend your airline to all our guest in our 5 star hotel in Abuja.. if you want to compete worlwide.. i reckon to start with the basic customer service.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
May,2018.0,Happy Experiences,Addis Ababa,Cape Town Central Africa Economy,"One of the reasons why I like flying with Ethiopian is their prices are generally the cheapest. Then its the baggage allowance - as a Star Alliance frequent flyer, first bag is 32kg and then two more of 23kg. One trolley bag of 8kg and a laptop backpack of 5kg. You can imagine how much shopping can be done with the allowances. But probably the best is that I get to stay over either going or coming or both at the expense of the airlines - hotel with meals. That gives me the opportunity to meet colleagues and to sight see. That is a really good bonus, but also with the stop over in Addis, it makes the journey easier as it is two trips instead of one long one. At times, there are the niggly issues - not having a reserved meal, or the in-screen entertainment is not working properly, but that is minor.",3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

May,2018.0,Exceeded my expectations,Addis Ababa,Dubai International Business Class,"I travelled on Ethiopian Airlines in business class from Addis to Dubai on a Boeing 777-200. The flight was in May 2018; I was connecting from another flight I’ve reviewed separately. LOUNGE Business class passengers use the Cloud Nine Lounge 2 (I think the ‘2’ refers to the fact that the lounge is in terminal 2). I was initially worried about a 4 hour layover in ADD, but I shouldn’t have bothered! It flew by! I spent around 90 minutes in the relaxation area in one of the massage chairs and slept well, really enjoyed the Ethiopian coffee ceremony near the entrance and managed to catch up on social media and charge my devices (as any good millennial must do!). I didn’t try any of the food but there was plenty available - the smoked salmon, fruit platters and egg station all looked really good. I was saving my appetite for onboard. One improvement would be showers, in particular, as many passengers seem to be connecting from other flights. It’s worth noting that the bathroom facilities are basic - I’m glad I had miniature toiletries in my hand luggage. Departure was from gate 10, which was a 2 minute walk from the lounge. Security was surprisingly quick and there was a clear priority line with a red carpet. Boarding was via an airbridge attached to door 2L. ONBOARD The 777-200 business cabin is in a 2-3-2 configuration. All business seats convert into fully flat beds. I was in 2L, which is a window seat on the right side of the aircraft. This is a good seat. Row 1 seems more exposed and is next to all of the noise of the galley. The left hand aisle seems to have more traffic as both of the business class toilets are located on that side. I was seated for around 10:05 and was really impressed with the pre departure experience: jacket immediately hung (with a courteous reminder not to leave valuables), variety of newspapers and magazines offered and champagne poured directly from the bottle. The business class cabin was completely full by the time we left, although - given various conversations between the crew - I wasn’t sure if a number of passengers had been upgraded. A plastic wrapped blanket, a great pillow, menu and noise cancellation earphones were all on my seat. The crew were very cheerful, polite and willing to engage in conversation. And they promptly brought me more champagne! A winner. Drink and food orders were also taken. Passengers were still boarding 5 minutes after our scheduled departure time, so we clearly weren’t leaving on time! A short announcement was made at around 10:35 about the cabin being sprayed. The flight time would be 3 hours and 15 minutes. Take off was finally at 11:15am so nearly an hour behind schedule. The captain made a short announcement at 11:35am: we expected to arrive at 3:50pm local time with very good weather. We were currently at 35,000 feet. The menu service started quickly. First up was a salad, smoked salmon starter, various condiments (including small pots of mayo, ketchup and wholegrain mustard) followed by a choice of white and brown rolls. For main course, there was a choice of chicken, lamb or salmon fillet. I opted for the lamb; it wasn’t great. It was warm rather than hot, quite small and the meat didn’t seem the best quality. I had food envy when I saw the salmon! Also, disappointingly, there was no Ethiopian meals loaded, nor was there on my earlier flight. A shame. Thankfully the dessert service was really quite impressive with four options all offered from a trolley. I opted for the cheese (three different types) and I was given a whole plum, orange and pear! I had an Ethiopian coffee with two tasty Lily O’Brian chocolates shortly afterwards. There was also another trolley run of drinks, this time with brandy, Bailey’s, port and various other options. Nobody should have gone hungry or thirsty on this flight! The rest of the flight was quite uneventful. Most passengers slept and it was great to have a fully flat bed and comfy pillow for such a short flight. I like to be cool when I sleep and found the cabin too warm. The visibility over the UAE was poor, which was a shame as I’d photographed various African landscapes earlier in the flight and was hoping to get something similar of Dubai! Landing was at 16:00 local time. ARRIVALS The taxi was relatively long, but that’s normal in Dubai. Disembarkation was through door 1L using an airbridge. On leaving the aircraft all business class passengers were given a card to use the priority immigration line. This was the quickest arrivals experience I’ve had in Dubai: a very short line for immigration (both for the regular and fast track lines - I wish I’d had that card on previous trips....) a short wait for my suitcase (albeit mine was thankfully one of the first off) and straight into a waiting taxi outside. Overall this was another impressive flight with Ethiopian. The lounge is basic but most of the basics are there: places to seat and sleep, decent WiFi, great coffee and a good selection of food and other drinks. I found the onboard experience very good too: really strong hard product, free flowing champagne, a variety of other drinks and a pleasant hard working crew. The food was a mixed bag with plenty available but the main courses on two consecutive flights were underwhelming. I would fly Ethiopian again without hesitation; I’m wondering what they are like in economy.......!",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,TripAdvisor

Jun,2018.0,customer service the poorest,Buenos Aires,Tel Aviv,"Buenos Aires to Tel Aviv via Addis Ababa. The customer service was the poorest! First, they charged me $300 more than what it shoes on their app - when I called customer service I had to wait more than 40 minutes to get to a representative that hardly spoke English and told me to Email them. When I did, they responded more than a week later saying the currency exchange was wrong and I was charged in Argentinian pesos and not in the local Ethiopian currency. At some point, they stopped responding to my emails. When I got to Tel Aviv I found out that my belongings in the checked suitcase were broken. I took pictures and sent it to the airline support email, I could only send one picture at the time. Although I sent several Email, I did not get a single response. On the day of the flight, I had 19 hours connection stop in Ethiopia, according to their policy I was supposed to get a night in a hotel, at their expense, which I was supposed to get during the check-in. The lady at the kiosk in Tel Aviv was so rude and kept me waiting till the 15 minutes before boarding, saying I could have booked a later flight and avoid the wait, therefore I'm not entitled to an overnight stay on their expense. Needless to say that when I booked the flight there was no such option (to avoid the wait with a shorter connection). After waiting for her to contact the whole airport, and texting a couple of private friends that had nothing to do with my flight, she told me I have 15 minutes to get to the gate or I will lose my flight. At the gate, I spoke with the ""supervisor"" who told me I should speak to the airline rep in Ethiopia, when I get there. She also screamed at me, saying its my fault for not choosing shorter connection time, even though I explained to her that I was never given the option. The rep's desk in Ethiopia didn't help much as well, but at the very least they were nice enough to plain to me that the kiosk in Tel Aviv could put me on a later flight that same night and shorten my connection to 4.5 hours. They explained that ""they should have done it"" or at least offer me that option since that flight was almost empty. I had to spend 19 hours at the not-so-traveler friendly airport in Addis Ababa. My one and only, nightmare type experience with Ethiopian airlines came to an end as soon as I landed back in Buenos Aires.

Jun,2018.0,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,Johannesburg,Nairobi,"Johannesburg to Nairobi via Addis Adaba. I was hesitant to book with Ethiopian airlines, however the schedule suited us. We flew from Johannesburg to Nairobi with a stop over in Addis Adaba. Firstly our plane was delayed by a couple of hours in Addis Adaba which is no big deal however we were ushered into a gate that was a construction zone through security where we had to wait. There was no air conditioning and the drinking water tanks were all empty. When we finally got on the plane I had to ask 5 times for some water for my children. I had pre selected our seats and was told that due to traveling with children we could not sit in the selected seats as it was an exit row. So they reallocated our seats and we were not sitting with our 5 and 7 year old children. I argued that I was not willing to allow my young children to sit next to strangers. I was told that I had to swap myself with other passengers when I boarded the plane. Luckily the other passengers allowed us to sit together. No thanks to Ethiopian Airlines. I also noticed after boarding that our original allocated seats were NOT in an exit row. When we arrived at Nairobi 2 of our bags were missing. After spending over an hour filling out paperwork at the airport we finally got to leave without the 2 bags. After 3 days of having no clothes mosquito spray and toiletries which we had to purchase ourselves again, our bags were located and my safari company picked the bags up for us. When we received the bags they were both badly broken. I spoke to the manager when we returned to the airport and was told there was nothing she could do and we should speak to the manager when we arrive back to Johannesburg. I spoke to somebody at the desk in Johannesburg and he gave me more paperwork and was told somebody would contact me. It has now been 3 weeks and after I have sent many emails, messages etc I still haven’t heard back from the airline.",1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

Was not clear on booking they flights 2+3 was a stopover rather than a transfer which was nice except it led to ticketing confusion which annoyed their staff. Food was acceptable but ran out of options halfway. Great range of meal choices offered on the website. I picked a Hindi meal. These were not offered on any flights - only chicken or beef.

Jun,2018.0,one of my best economy flights,Addis Ababa,Khartoum,"Transited in Addis on my way to Khartoum on 8th June 2018. The airport (T2) is overcrowded, messy, and queues everywhere. Boarding tedious and waiting for ½-1 hour for the bus in overcrowded narrow room at Gate 13. We became >½ hours late departing, but as the plane was full it was almost excusable. As the pax-load was full and the aircraft was a smaller B737-800 they were seizing and checking in hand-luggage for a lot of overloaded passengers, inclusive of myself. I argued that I need to go with my hand-luggage as I was only transiting in KRT and could not retrieve it easily without a visa to Sudan. After some discussion they eventually allowed my two pieces to pass to be taken on board. On board I had one of my best economy flights for years: FAs were fit, well rested, effective, focused, and kind and expedite. Despite the flight was full and the duration were only 1½-2 hours, everything worked to perfection. Two hot meals offered, I chose a fish steak for breakfast. It was so good I had to inquire for one additional. Voila, in 6-8 seconds after I told this to the FA it was on my plate. Drinks offered were plenty including wine and beers. The brands were well selected and tasted very well for economy class. The FAs came around and asked if there were other requests they could assist with. They served us until we landed and there were no stops in service from kick-off till landing. They were so well groomed, professional, and neat. IFE were missing apart from radio/music access. The aircraft appeared new and in good condition despite being an old model. At arrival, two stairways were put up allowing for quick disembarking being taken by bus to the arrival area and then confronted with the harsh Sudanese immigration where huge patience is the strongest weapon to overcome the hurdles.",4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,AirlineQuality

Upgraded successfully from economy class by putting my modest bid through their homepage. Check-in was very lengthy as they could not issue the second boarding pass when I was upgraded on the first sector. I could not accept it and stood at the counter almost ½ hour before the second BP came out. Worth waiting for compared to waiting at a transfer counter in ADD to get it. It eventually went through and I then enjoyed the lounge access in KGL and good service on board in the four rows of business class (cabin ½ full). I was disappointed they only served breakfast as I needed dinner. But I spotted from the menu card the dinner served on the incoming flight. I then managed to secure my favourite dinner from that menu, despite it was not on offer and a few hours old, but reheated. Pre-departure champagne brut (“Lallier”) was fine. FAs attentive.

Cape Town to Addis Ababa was great but when we arrived in Addis Ababa we were rushed onto a bus and taken to the plane. Obviously this plane had just arrived from elsewhere, had offloaded passengers and there was no time to clean. Our seats were occupied by others who had the same boarding pass seat number as us so we had to move to other fitlhy seats (not cleaned). The crew were not in the least helpful and we had a miserable flight to Bangkok. Having said this the return trip was perfectly OK.

Returned via the same route and as Adis Ababa was rather busy at time of connection there were not sufficient indicators as to what gate to connect from which seemed to rattle a few travelers; but overall experience was fine. In flight entertainment was up to date and kept us entertained on a long flight! Food and beverage service and quality was up to standard compared to other airlines.

I know we have different cultures but there was no warmth that you'd expect if you are going to be on the flight for over 10hours! I declined the offer of one of the meals after tasting the first one. I was asked to help myself to drinking water at the galley after asking numerous times and only getting half a tumbler, not sure if this is a policy of only offering half a tumbler? The cabin is a very hot environment so why ration drinking water? This was an 14-18hour trip each way. At the Addis airport I decided to buy my own water, kept an empty bottle in the hope of replenishing it after security checks but was forced to throw the empty bottle in the bin! Then at the airport the toilets had no toilet paper and the flushes were showering as you pressed them, oh don't!

Our family members, who were flying economy, were put up in a place with electrical wires hanging down, dirty bathrooms, and where our grandson was severely bitten by a spider. We would have had them stay with us, but the Ethiopian Airlines representative insisted that their hotel was a nice place. Our flight out the next day caused us to miss another set of connections. Looks like Ethiopian Airlines has low priority status at busy airports. Our return trips were much them same but relatively on time. Our flight crews varied from reasonably competent and pleasant to down-right nasty. Special ordered meals for members of our party with severe dietary restrictions and confirmed multiple times on EA's website showed up for only two of the meals. Three flight crews just shrugged and blew it off. Two others tried to be helpful. Planes are relatively new but not well-maintained inside.

Jun,2018.0,"Horrible airline - unexpected layovers to pick up more passengers, terrible customer service",Kilimanjaro National Park,Addis Ababa Africa Economy,"Soon after boarding, it was announced that the plane would be making a stop somewhere to ""refuel"". This is a flight from Kilimanjaro to Addis Ababa - why would the plane need to refuel for that? Anyway, I wasn't bothered because I know there are MULTIPLE internation airports enroute. However, they took us to Kigali, Rwanda, which is in an entirely different direction than where we needed to go. When we got there, they onboarded tons of people, and I quickly realized this stop wasn't to refuel, it was just to pick people up. The whole ordeal took an extra 2-3 hours, so I missed my layover in Addis Ababa. It was about 11 PM when we landed. I went to the customer service desk to ask them to find me a new flight, and they tried to tell me that it wasn't their fault. How was this not their fault that they made an unplanned stop for more customers?? I had to fight for over an hour just to get them to start trying to help me. Finally, around 2 AM I had a new flight and a hotel voucher. They told me they would reroute my bags, too, and I watched how the guy did it - he sent an email out to ALL airport staff saying something along the lines of ""please put these bags onto this flight..."". So it was no surprise when my bags didn't make it onto my new flight. The technology and processes they use are completely outdated. I was shocked that they were using email for this process. Their process looking for flights was also much more complicated due to their technology. They had no way to IM eachother, so they resort to phone calls, but its so noisy that they can barely hear one another. I almost wanted to pitch some new tech solutions to them, but I was too annoyed. I will try with all my might to avoid ever having to take a flight with Ethiopian Airlines again. However, if anyone from Ethiopian Airlines wants to talk to me about updating their processes and systems, I'd be happy to offer my ideas.",2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Overall, flight was comfortable but then our luggage didn’t arrive with us and staff at delhi airport had no clue about this and had no electronic system to check and just lodged the missing bag complaint.

The seats were spacious and very comfortable. Lots of leg room and lay flat. The check-in was super easy in London, they greeted us with a warm smile and within 10 minutes we were all checked in and ready to go through security. A perk of travelling business class is the ability to get Fast Track at the London airport through security. Once we boarded the flight, the flight attendants had a smile and welcomed us on-board and as soon as were were settled in, we were offered juice or champagne. On board service was excellent. The crew was friendly throughout the flight. The highlight of this journey was the amazing food they had on-board. My wife is a vegetarian and they had a Biryani with lentils, my wife said the taste was delicious. Me on the other hand the Chicken which also was amazingly tasty.

Jun,2018.0,Worst airline I have ever encounted,Johannesburg,Nairobi Africa Economy,"I was hesitant to book with Ethiopian airlines based on reviews I had read. However the schedule suited us. We flew from Johannesburg to Nairobi with a stop over in Addis Adaba. Firstly our plane was delayed by a couple of hours in Addis Adaba which is no big deal however we were ushered into a gate that was a construction zone through security where we had to wait. There was no air conditioning and the drinking water tanks were all empty. When we finally got on the plane I had to ask 5 times for some water for my children. I had pre selected our seats and was told that due to traveling with children we could not sit in the selected seats as it was an exit row. So they reallocated our seats and we were not sitting with our 5 and 7 year old children. I argued that I was not willing to allow my young children to sit next to strangers. I was told that I had to swap myself with other passengers when I boarded the plane. Luckily the other passengers allowed us to sit together. No thanks to Ethiopian Airlines. I also noticed after boarding that our original allocated seats were NOT in an exit row. When we arrived at Nairobi 2 of our bags were missing. After spending over an hour filling out paperwork at the airport we finally got to leave without the 2 bags. After 3 days of having no clothes mosquito spray and toiletries which we had to purchase ourselves again, our bags were located and my safari company picked the bags up for us. When we received the bags they were both badly broken beyond repair. I spoke to the manager when we returned to the airport and was told there was nothing she could do and we should speak to the manager when we arrive back to Johannesburg. I spoke to somebody at the desk in Johannesburg and he gave me more paperwork and was told somebody would contact me. It has now been 3 weeks and after I have sent many emails, messages etc I still haven’t heard back from the airline. This airline states that it has a goal of being the best airline in Africa.

Our connection time was perfect since we took off from CT and we were scheduled to only collected our Baggage in Bangkok. A month prior to our flight I was informed by our TRavel Agent that Ethiopian Air had cancelled the Addis- Bangkok leg of the flight meaning we would have to remain in Addis 24 hours and only fly to BKK the following day! A few weeks past and we were informed that they had reinstated the flight but that meant a mere 30 minutes ‘legal’ layover time in Addis. I insisted on documentation prior to our flight to confirm that we would not miss our connection and requested written confirmation pertaining to the steps that would ensure we had a smooth plane- bus - plane transfer. This was provided and assured prior to our departure. Things turned sour when we were delayed 45 minutes # at CT International. We therefore landed long after our connection was due to depart. Once again we were assured by cabin crew that the plane would wait for us as we were not the only ones affected. We received written as well as verbal reassurance that we would not have to go through transfers. What transpired was pure chaos. We were herded like cattle into the Bangkok Shuttle bus which proceeded to take us on a round- a - bout trip to the terminal. We were directed to no mans lans and again pacified to believing that they were channeling us in the right direction! To no avail. It was horrid. Eventually an honest ground crew staff member admitted that our flight had departed without us.hints were made that one piece of luggage was in Addis airport and the other bound for Bangkok. Pure chaos, complacency, a horrid, crazy experience! We duly missed our BKK - Hanoi flight which I had booked and paid for 8 months prior. Also missed a day and night which we had planned to spend in Hanoi and certainly not Addis Ababa. Efficient , slick, professional organizational skills are clearly lacking under the Ethiopian Airline banner! Very sad indeed. Spent a night and wasted day in an awful hotel in Addis.

Causing the further delay. But then after landing in Addis we were rebooked, but no information was given, so you have no idea what to do, where to go, or where you are rebooked! Then when rebooked via Vienna to Frankfurt, again the connection time too short, With another delay, missed the second flight! so had to be re-booked again, This required back and forth from several counters & terminals, as nobody could confirm what the process is. When talking to cabin crew about connecting flights or plans, they answered “we will talk to ground staff when we land” I pointed out that this would be too late as my flight would have left by then! I know there is radio contact with operations on the ground from the plane, they could have found out the plan and informed all the passengers before we landed, which flight,which gate and all such information, this would have eleviated a little of the stress we as passengers were experiencing. Also the cabin crew did not seem to have control of the passengers, not only were passengers helping themselves to stuff off the trolly, most passengers were up out of their seats before the aircraft had stopped, all because they didn’t know what the status of their connection was. And no crew told anyone to return to seats (seatbelt signs were still on) I also stood up, not knowing if my connecting flight was waiting or had already departed.

Terrible service (unfriendly air hostesses), terrible food, pilot landed fast - almost flipping the plane, my online pre-selected seat was changed in Brussels by ground staff at check in to a seat directly next to the toilet, the airport at Addis Abeba is an absolute nightmare with congestion, no one knowing where to go.

Jun,2018.0,I think I'm finished with this airline,Cape Town Central,Washington DC International Economy,"This is the third major trip I've taken with this airline for a total of 12 flights -- twice to Kenya and once to South Africa. From now on I'm going another way. The final straw was a delayed flight from Cape Town, which meant we missed our connection in Addis and had to stay 24 hours for the next available flight back to the States. The delay was a technical glitch, and I do not blame the airline for that. I blame them for putting us up in a lousy hotel while we waited. At least half the plane had to be accommodated. Apparently some had a great place that even had a pool, spa, and a hair salon, but we were put up in the African equivalent of the ""Happiness Hotel"" (think The Great Muppet Caper). While luxury is certainly not necessary, we should have been put in a place that had decent rooms with towels and shampoo in the bathrooms and a hair dryer available. We weren't allowed access to our luggage, so certainly the airline could figure out that we'd need some help. And speaking of luggage.... All of our soft-side luggage was soaking wet when we got it home. Our clothes had to go right in the wash, and we needed to dry out everything else. One book was ruined. It was raining the day we were stuck in Addis Ababa and, at least for a while, our luggage was clearly waiting outside. The other thing I realized about flying this airline is that because of its hub location in Addis, other airlines aren't available to take up the slack. We couldn't be re-routed. Then there is the fact that the airline personnel just cannot seem to control its passengers. In every location I've been in (five), the crew can't manage the embarkation process, and there is pushing and shoving and basic chaos. There are some good things about this airline. Leg room is okay, for one. But basically I have come to the conclusion that the experience is just not worth the savings.",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Immediate complaining resulted in being ""resettled"" near the corridor for the first flight, whereas it was seemingly impossible to do the same with the second one until reaching the transfer desk in Addis Abeba.

Jun,2018.0,4/5 given due to the pricepoint for business class,London,Lilongwe International Business Class,"Flew in June from London <-> Lilongwe, via Addis. Business Class ticket was approx £1,800 - vs. £850ish Economy. Outbound: - Flies from Heathrow T2, super quick check in and no other people in the fast track queue for evening flight out on a Saturday - Access to the united lounge, with decent food and a good selection of drinks at the bar - Boarding process worked well and got into a new A350, albeit fitted out at a lower spec than a Qatar or similar high end airline (the price point reflect this, which is why I give them 4/5) - Seats are flat, albeit they don't all have direct aisle access in the 2 + 2 + 2 configuration they use. - Champagne nothing too special, but pleasant. Amenity kit also average only - Didn't eat the food as we wanted to sleep. Somewhat annoyingly they clattered about for a long time serving people who hadn't eaten beforehand - Nice big touch screen fixed in place (better than BA!), but a limited selection to watch - Overall though, a good flight leg Addis: - Routed down to a small and awful terminal for next leg of flight. Waited for 2 hours with no wifi or access to drinks, rather than being routed to lounge in other terminal. A bit annoying, and not a great experience. Will improve when new terminal is finished in the next year or so To Lilongwe: - An old plane, shared video screens, but it's a 3hr 20 mins flight, so fine. - Food was terrible, but coffee and snacks tasty - Seats, 2+2 config, just recline a bit - but it was enough for the short flight Return flights similar experience, although their Lilongwe check in was a bit painful as they didn't really prioritise the Business Class queue. Cloud Nine lounge at Addis is fine, albeit gets crowded. Overall, a much better business experience than I was expecting given the price point and airline. This isn't like flying Qatar, Emirates, or Singapore, but holds up against a few others IMO - given it's half the cost.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

The airport (T2) is overcrowded, messy, and queues everywhere. Boarding tedious and waiting for ½-1 hour for the bus in overcrowded narrow room at Gate 13. We became >½ hours late departing, but as the plane was full it was almost excusable. As the pax-load was full and the aircraft was a smaller B737-800 they were seizing and checking in hand-luggage for a lot of overloaded passengers, inclusive of myself. I argued that I need to go with my hand-luggage as I was only transiting in KRT and could not retrieve it easily without a visa to Sudan. After some discussion they eventually allowed my two pieces to pass to be taken on board. On board I had one of my best economy flights for years: FAs were fit, well rested, effective, focused, and kind and expedite. Despite the flight was full and the duration were only 1½-2 hours, everything worked to perfection. Two hot meals offered, I chose a fish steak for breakfast. It was so good I had to inquire for one additional. Voila, in 6-8 seconds after I told this to the FA it was on my plate. Drinks offered were plenty including wine and beers. The brands were well selected and tasted very well for economy class. The FAs came around and asked if there were other requests they could assist with. They served us until we landed and there were no stops in service from kick-off till landing. They were so well groomed, professional, and neat. IFE was missing apart from radio/music access. The aircraft appeared new and in good condition despite being an old model.

Jun,2018.0,You get what you pay for,Ndola,London International Economy,"I recently had to visit the UK at short notice at minimum expense. Ethiopian offered the flight at substantially less than any of the competition, with reasonable connection times. I overcame my reluctance to pass through Bole International Airport and went ahead and bought the ticket. Maybe I’m just unlucky with Ethiopian, but in the last 4 flights I have done with them, I have been delayed twice long enough to miss my connection, and have also been loaded on to a plane with a boarding pass for a seat that did not exist. Our flight out of Heathrow was delayed for 3 hours - once everyone was loaded on the plane and the doors were locked. We were told it was due to weather, but the belly doors were still open and luggage was still being loaded well after our scheduled departure time. There was no sign of bad weather (though we did fly over Europe on a more northerly route than we had arrived). Ethiopian are unlikely to win any awards with their cuisine, and there are no convenient extra’s like traveling tooth brush and toothpaste given out. Their entertainment is adequate, but not world class. For some reason, their aircraft always manage to look a bit frayed around the edges even when brand new. On their new A350, the emergency procedure cards were already tattered and dog eared and my neighbour’s screen only worked after being re-started 3 or 4 times. On a brand new 737Max, my headphone socket was broken and we had emergency cards for the wrong model plane. The airline can’t escape from being associated with the atrocious Bole International Airport, where passengers are sent to everlasting torment. I had the privilege of boarding from gate 1B, where they board 2 flights at a time, with no PA system and no screen. Not an enjoyable experience. The bottom line is that when I have flown Ethiopian, I have always arrived at my destination safe and sound, and have collected my baggage, no more than 28 hours from my expected arrival time, so they get the job done in the end.",3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

There was NO crew to be seen, and for 10 minutes we waited on our deaths!! Then an announcement from the pilot saying the technical problem has been solved. Needless to say we were severely traumitised!!! Up to this day ( despite numerous requests to the airline) we are still waiting for an explanation or apology!! We rescheduled our return flights on another airline at huge extra costs as we were not prepared to fly back on Ethiopian Airlines! This leaves us with the question: Will we recommend them??

I think the staff maintained a good humour about it.. the trip back was a bit more riddled with hurdles. We tried to do an online check in the night before, but the website wouldn't let me check in, although the other two went fine. It also wouldn't find the second leg of our journey. Calls to the help desk were a waste of time.. the chap couldn't do anything, except get me checked in for the first leg. We got to the airport and were informed that we had been taken off the second leg of our journey due a glitch.We were fine, chirping away and the staff were apologetic and helpful. The lady at the check in desk was super accomodating.. we didn't realise it at the time, but as the flight wasn't full, she had booked us a row each for the longest leg, so we were able to lie down..I could have hugged her!!

Jul,2018.0,The perfect nightmare!,Bangkok,Buenos Aires International Economy,"The perfect nightmare of an international traveler: 1. Payment issues. We booked the ticket through Expedia, and to cut the long story short it took about a month to get the confirmation that the fee was actually charged and we can fly. 2. Flight experience. The planes are old and messy. The seat cover looks like a rag from the 19th century. The toilets were unusable towards the end of our 16h flight. No one cleaned them during the flight. 3. Addis Ababa airport. Is a makeshift construction, where the doors of the smoking room remain open and that makes the whole wing stink with cigarette smell. The toilets were dirty, and when you flush it the water, it spills all around. Although there was a cleaning lady in the toilets and the jar for tips, the trash bins were overflowing, no soap and no hand towels. There are no working ATMs, so you better have some cash on you, as the coffee shops do not accept credit cards. Hygiene and customer service were not to be found in those coffee shops. On our way back, they changed the gates a few times, and there were no proper announcements made, so the staff directed us some time to the opposing ends of the airport. 4. Luckily, they have on-line registration. However, even a boarding pass in your hands does not guarantee that you will get on your flight. When I came to drop my bags, I was requested to present a yellow fever certificate to return to my destination. In my experience, the airline as a courtesy informs you of any health or admin requirements that a traveler may not be reasonably aware of (like a shot before you return to the country of ORIGIN). They refused to board me on the flight, and the fee to change the fight was a full fare. Don’t be fooled by their cheap prices, you may end up paying twice! 5. In addition to that, the promised refund never came. When applying for a refund, bear in mind that you will need to liaise with your booking agent, bank and payment system to demonstrate that you have purchased the ticket from them. They told me that their record showed that ticket was never issued, although we were charged, and actually flew! It takes a 20 min wait to reach a person on the helpline, and after another 20 minutes the line will be cut off, and you will have to repeat the whole process again. In conclusion, if you really hate someone buy them Ethiopian Airlines ticket. Only then your money is well spent.",2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

We have contacted the airlines several times at our own cost with little support from them and only 4 days later we received the lost bag, but it was also damaged.

Jul,2018.0,Dublin - LAX. Wonderful staff. Good experience.,Dublin,Los Angeles International Economy,"Well done Ethiopian! Myself, my partner and two children flew Dub-LAX return and we were delighted. I am tall so benefitted from the extra space in row 11. Good choice of movies. Loved the examples of Ethiopian music available also - a great introduction. Food was typical airline fare, nothing really stood out but it was entirely edible and tasty. Our teens are fussy eaters though and didnt like the food, but we anticipated this and we had brought plenty of carry-on snacks with us from the airport. The Ethiopian coffee was superb, best I have ever had on a flight. The cabin crew were efficient and friendly, their smiles were infectious! They have to work so hard though! One of the best things about this flight was its early morning departure which meant that we were in LAX at 10.30am. The return flight to Dublin was great also, as it departed at midnight, allowing you to sleep most of the night. For the price we paid for effectively four adult fares, we were blown away by the value for money we got - given the low fares, we would have been happy with Ryanair-level service, but what we got was something approaching (but not quite up to) the Aer Lingus standard. The only negative I can think of was that on the outbound flight, the pull-up tv screen in row 11 was very dirty and sticky, while on the return journey, the screen in the same row was not working at all, and there were no alternative seats available - luckily I wanted to sleep during the flight!

However, when you have ISSUES with your Ethiopian booking that's when a different story altogether. I was told (after I had emailed customer services regarding my seats) that there was a problem with my booking and my ticket was not valid for travel. Hmm, funny that I distinctly remembered a debit of over 1000 euro from my account with the description ""Ethiopian Airlines"" and perhaps a few numbers and letters thrown in. To make a long story short, I rang customer services 8 times over the course of a week to find out what was going on with my ticket, which was clearly paid for looking at my bank statement. After almost two weeks of fixing a ridiculous mistake on their part, they told me my ticket was finally valid for travel on a Friday - I was travelling that Monday and their phone lines close at the weekend. I still wonder: A) When were they going to tell me my ticket wasn't valid. They happened to mention it when I emailed them about something else. B) Why their customer service was appalling. I was constantly told someone would ring me back - that never happened, I had to keep ringing to find out what was going on with my ticket. C) Why I didn't get much of an apology or explanation as to what happened. Endured almost two weeks of stress waiting to find out that my ticket was actually valid for travel. 1000 euro is a lot of money - yes mistakes can be made but one should at least be entitled to decent customer service after paying out that much money for a big, well-known airline.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Since then, we have been trying to get a reasonable answer for this, but no one, not even someone among the senior people of the airline had the decency to even answer our claim. A polite 'voice' on Facebook tells you that they are sorry for the inconvenience and that they would be glad to assist you, but this is all for show. A month later and still no response. This is ET: they do whatever they like to their customers, even cheat them, and then ignore them if they try to complain. Their Customer Commitment statement on the website is a real joke.

I finally manage to depart Addis Ababa at 0415 hours on a different airline and obviously reached my destination very late. Upon arrival at Athens I found that my luggage was missing. Although I finally found my luggage five days later, this spoiled my experience.

Many of friends have running stomach after eating traditional food (Injira-which I personally love) 3. Lounges are cramped with no shower facilities. Restrooms are unclean and like communal toilets in a village environment. During rush hours (which is almost 24 hours), people have to wait for their turn with rancor 4. Too much non-veg food around and the quality of vegetarian and vegan food is not good. Variety is a complete miss. 5. Value for money -Low end.

Fleet type that operates from Addis to Dar is sooo old, even some of seats are broken. It still needs improvements.

The attendants were a little hard to deal with and lost their patience way sooner with passengers than they should. The two things that were very annoying: asking me to take the emergency aisle seat but then not allowing me to keep my small back pack under the seat so I was without cough drops, tissues, or water. I would not have moved there had I known that and five hours is too long to not have earphones, water, etc. The second annoying thing is the bassinets they place in front of you if you happen to sit beside a baby, leaving you unable to get up to visit the restroom and encroaching on your space.

They were able to recline it manually - but this was not what I expected. In a stop over in Dublin - someone actually came and fixed the problem (now that was a surprise) so the next 6 hours back to Toronto were great.

Jul,2018.0,Please Make This A Better Experience,Addis Ababa,Entebbe Africa Business Class,"I was very disappointed with the experience at Bole International Airport. The flight got in quite some time after the scheduled time having departed late from Accra. We landed ten minutes before my connecting flight. I brought this to attention of the flight attendants who were similarly concerned and immediately informed ground staff to assist me. The ground staff, however, could not be bothered. They made no special arrangements to aid me to make my fight. I had to board the same bus as everyone else and wait for it to fill up. When we got to the terminal, rather than provide a cart the staff demanded that I run the length of the airport to make the flight. Bearing in mind my weight and age as well as the airline's culpability in the situation I refused. After some brisk walking I got to the Cloud9 boarding gate with four minutes to go. All that effort only to be told the gate was closed. Again, I was told to run to the general boarding gate. Again I refused. After some rude comments the staff determined that the sensible action was to radio ahead and accompany me to the gate. Upon arrival, I had to wait almost an hour before a bus was dispatched to take a number of passengers and I to the aircraft. Apparently, my earlier flight wasn't the only one delayed. After boarding we waited a further half hour for a second busload before taking off. The aircraft was in poor condition. The interior was old and not particularly clean. The seats were uncomfortable and some functions do not work. Inflight entertainment was poor as there was no variety. Surely, Ethiopian can do better on such a busy route. At the very least the cabin can be refurbished or the seats changed.",2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor
Jul,2018.0,Pleasant Surprise,Accra,Addis Ababa Africa Business Class,I have been pleasantly surprised with the quality of service provided by Ethiopian Air on the Accra route.

Service on board was good when given but I noticed it takes the pursers quite a while to respond when the call button is pushed. On this occasion if took about fifteen minutes and pushing the call button at least three times to either be noticed or for the staff to decide to attend to me.

Jul,2018.0,It was better than I expected.,Rome,Victoria International Economy,"First let me tell you that my partner and I live in Malta, which means we have to take a flight to another city with a bigger airport for international flights. We usually fly with Turkish Airlines when it comes to exotic destinations such as Maldives, Seychelles, Bali, etc. - which has only 1 stop in Istanbul and voila! Why didn't we fly with TA this time? Simple: we wanted to book a roundtrip ticket and the day we were returning back from Seychelles TA was not flying. As we were already spending 17 days in Seychelles, we were not interested in booking 2 more nights in order to fly with TA. Another side note with TA was (apart of the usual rudeness of the staff both in the plane and in the lounges) the big layover of 10 hours from/to Istanbul/Seychelles! The other solution was flying to Rome and then fly with Ethiopian Airline who had a late flight at 11 PM to Addis Ababa and a shorter layover of 4 hours before heading to Seychelles, for quite a cheap price: €250 p.p including 2 big bags of 30Kg per person for Economy! However Ethiopian would mean an airline from... Ethiopia! I mean, we were pretty scared! What if they loose our luggage? What if they have delays, what if the food or staff are terrible? How is the airport? While I googled to gather the maximum info about Ethiopian Airline, I must say the reviews were pretty scary! After ponderation, we decided to give it a try as we like to make our own opinions nevertheless and we booked it literally 2-3 days before our departure! Here are the positive points by flying Ethiopian: 1. Pre-ordered Meals: my partner and I are both Vegans so we had to call during the weekend to order our vegan meals for all the 4 flights as our first flight was Monday at 11 PM. Even during weekends they took our order and delivered it! With TA or literally any other airline, they would never make it possible because we ordered during a Saturday or Sunday and it has to be ordered 24h to 48h week-days before! We had vegan meals in all the 4 flights and it was pretty good! We were even served first! 2. You can bring 2 check-in bags of 30Kg per person in Economy! I mean this is pretty cool! 3. The ladies serving us in the plane were actually pretty helpful if you talk politely and with a smile. 4. Price! The price of €250 p.p to Seychelles was incredible! With TA we would have paid €400 from Rome and €800 from Malta p.p! Now the bad points or the ""why it was so cheap"": 1. You have to pay extra to reserve your seat: so we wanted to be sure we will be next to each other and on a window side (where there are only 3 seats) instead of the middle row which has 4 seats. It was 20euros per flight (€10 each) so €80 just for the seats. 2. The interior of the planes do look a bit old and they don't have much leg space, my partner is quite tall so it was a bit more stressful for him than for me. 3. The worst negative point of the journey is for sure the Addis Ababa Airport: oh boy! This is really once you land there that you understand why it was such a cheap flight! The experience is beyond terrible and stressful. The airport looks totally improvised and built in an old factory, the WC is well... a challenge! 4. Terrible Airport facilities and Security: There are no lounges except the one from Ethiopian Airline, no proper restaurants not even a Starbucks! Wifi has to be purchased otherwise it simply doesn't work! And you have to pass thru security and remove your shoes even if you are on flip-flops and walk on the floor barefoot! Just disgusting! 5. Lost our luggage: This is where I was really the most afraid of! Ethiopian managed to keep our luggage on Addis Ababa Airport even after double checking with them to be sure our checked-in bags (with final destination Seychelles) were on the plane to Seychelles. On a 4 hours layover this is inadmissible! They manage to deliver the luggage 24 hours after our arrival in Seychelles directly to our hotel and nothing was stolen so ultimately the problem got solved. 6. Over 60 minutes delay to take off from Addis Ababa: We were in the plane but we had to wait for our turn to take off and this took 60 minutes. Overall, I gave 3 stars because we did 4 flights with them safely and nothing happened to us; despite the fact our luggage took 24 hours to arrive, they were not damaged and nothing was stolen; the vegan food on the plane was really good; staff was helpful. I'm not sure if I would fly with them again as the layover in Addis Ababa was nevertheless quite a stressful and a tiring experience due to the very poor conditions of the airport. In very exceptional cases I would recommend flying with them: 1. If the price is like half of the competition and the layover is short (no more than 4-5 hours); and 2. you book your seats before. Hope it was helpful for all! Best, Melanie",3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

She was the rudest person in this industry I have ever encountered, her manager on duty no better.

Jul,2018.0,Not worth the U$8000 Business Class ticket,Toronto,Addis Ababa International Business Class,"While trying hard to be a world class airline, compared to the services of the major carriers plying intercontinental routes, ET still falls short of its claim to be Africa's best carrier. The service both onboard and on the ground was disappointing. Boarding was disorganized even at Toronto where the queue meant for business class also had people from economy, later to be told we had to go first to another counter to get our documents checked. There was no sign that you had to go to that counter first before queuing up. Agents were unsmiling and looked harassed. Once on board, cabin crew took my order for a Western meal but once they came out with the wheeled tray of food, they ladled out the national dish which was very spicy. Meat was tough and overcooked. No ice cream. Dessert was unimaginative and cheese platter did not look fresh. At least the plane was a new dreamliner and had a wide array of movies. I took business class as I was on a business class trip to Mozambique and had 22 hours of travel time. I was looking forward to some respite on the ground but the lounges in Addis Ababa were crammed with transit passengers and did not offer a relaxing atmosphere. Cloud 9 Lounge facilities and food was also very limited and also disappointing. No shower facilities. Difficult to find a place to sit. Didn't eat there as a result.

On the outbound flight we tried to enquire on carrying of puppies and they are clueless literally reading off what’s on their site like robots with no exception. Finally was told to contact an agent but Ethopian Airlines will charge us as clients.Thats after cargo section even hang on me rudely by saying they have technical difficulties and the gentleman couldn’t even let me finish my words. 6years ago we used this Airline and they messed up the accommodation reservation with their Bole ambassador hotel for my husband and he ended up sleeping on the bench as the connection time was more than 24hours! Regardless of planning and paying just to be told he had no visa but why would you accept money. We thought after 6years things would change but clearly these people have it jumbled up. Such Airlines shouldn’t be allowed Internationally let them stick to flying locally in their country as they put a bad name on Flight service.

I did not note the 3 persons’ name and address to express gratitude that I was not robbed on July 2 night.

There was no #Ethiopian @flyethiopian ground staff to be seen so we had to push and shav our way up the staircase to the plane. The flight left late and arrived 1.5hrs late to Manila. The #Ethiopian @flyethiopian flight crew seemed undertrained, lacking of basic hospitality skills sometimes boarderlining rude more so during the inbound flight to Addis.

We were a little apprehensive given the first flight would be 18 hours connecting through Ethiopia, and the second flight another 6 hours to South Africa. That’s a long time to rely on the comfort and service of an unknown product but I give them fully credit! First, they’re flying brand new well maintained aircraft. Our business class seats were full lie flat beds on every leg, with pillows and blankets as well as amenity kits provided on each as well. Amenity kits included socks, eye mask, toothbrush, hairbrush, chapstick and a pen for filling out your landing forms. They were also great with the service carts, coming around regularly. In fact all told we had 6 meals on board, and each was an assortment of enough western and African foods to carefully feed everyone. Additionally the business class meals had a first, second and desert course an constant drink pours so there was no chance of getting that mid-air hunger and not knowing if/when you’d be able to eat. I also give them great credit for serving the breakfast/lunch/dinner foods in accordance with the time of arrival - which helped force us onto Africa time and skirt jet lag which was a big concern with a 32 hour travel time. The planes also had the all important cabin mood lighting so they were able to gently force you into local time by recreating the correct level of light for where you were going. It was impressive actually how incredibly comfortable and well taken care of we were. If I need to spend a day and a half in 6 square feet I wouldn’t hesitate to do it with Ethiopian again! Only note of warning they did consistently run late at every leg. It was never a concern for us as our entire itinerary was on one ticket with them so we weren’t in danger of missing anything but if you were booking different connectors with other airlines I would buffer at least 2-3 hours into your transfers to be safe. our departure which was set to leave LA at 00:30 didn’t even start boarding until well after meaning our ADD landing scheduled for 4 am actually got in after 6am.

When we got off the airport was closed, they said there were no hotels available but when we went on booking.com we found space immediately. When we checked in the hotel told us they had not heard from Ethiopian airlines. The hotel was approximately 5mins away by cab. Definitely within 25 miles. Some people did not have the funds or knowledge to do this and had to sleep as best they could at the airport. There was no one to tell us what was going to happen other than to come back at 17.00 but what were we meant to do from 1am - 17.00. Their customer service line just rang and rang and I was put on hold for 1 hour. When someone finally answered I had been redirected to Ethiopia and the person on the other end could not help me. We are traveling to Botswana and the next direct flight from Addis to Gaborone is in 2 days time. I have been told they will fly us to Johannesburg and then gabs but have no idea when the flights are or when we can expect to finally get to Gaborone. I am concerned that if I get on the flight this evening once I am in Addis I will be at their mercy as to when and how they get me to my destination. I understand that things happen my reason for giving a bad score is that they have consistently let their passengers down from not keeping us informed of their issues on the tarmac, not finding accommodation for us, not having anyone to let us know what is happening, leaving us for close to 24hrs with no point of contact.",3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

The food was local food, although with a mixture of very spiced to mild which was a bonus for those without well developed taste buds. The drink selection was very good, with nothing being too much for any of the staff, from a coffee right through to hard liquor. For me the highIight was the seat the folded completely flat; the Business pod that you stay in was similar to that of Emirates, you can see what this airline is trying to model themselves around.

Jul,2018.0,"Very bad communication, very bad lounge, took my Mom's walker without explanation",Kilimanjaro National Park,Frankfurt International Business Class,"My wife and I flew with my Mom back from our wonderful Tanzanian safari, but had a pretty poor experience flying Ethiopian Airlines. My Mom flew first class on our legs from Kilimanjaro to Frankfurt, while my wife and I flew economy. My Mom requires a walker to get around due to her arthritis. When we asked for wheelchair assistance and told them my Mom needs to use the lift to get on the plane, the ground crew acted like this was a hassle, even though we specified we needed this service when we booked the trip. Since this airport doesn't have jet bridge service this means the crew needs to use a truck and lift to get people in wheelchairs on board. But they did accommodate us. But while we were being put on the truck to put us on board, one of the agents asked to take my Mom's walker, and I told him she needs it to walk around when getting on/off the plane. He insisted that he take it from me and indicated he'd put in under the plane. I asked several of the flight attendants why they are doing this and told them we needed this walker when we got off, as we'd need to walk to our connection in Addis Ababa. The short story is, the walker was nowhere to be found, no one could tell us what happened. The crew that was on board really didn't seem to care that much about the situation and couldn't explain to us what was going on, so Mom was left to walk for a while without a wheelchair being provided and without her walker. We finally got the walker back when we landed at Frankfurt, thanks to one agent there that understood what we needed. But it was really a poor showing overall for Ethiopian and given we paid for a first class seat - we expected a lot more from this airline that seems to be getting a lot of accolades. The other interesting note is the utterly awful lounge in Addis Ababa for Ethiopian Airlines. The bathrooms were disgusting, the chairs and decor were dated and inadequate given the number of people at this hub airport. The food was decent but that's the only positive thing I'd say.

Here are the problems i enounters which you may wish to look out for: 1) the departure for one of the flight was advanced for 1.5 hr. It informs me by email. So always make sure that you leave them with correct email. 2) Even if the flight departs on time, it can be late for arrival which is very surprising (without any traffic jam, detour, delay in landing etc). One of my flights had delayed by 1.5 hr by arrival, thereby shortened my transit time for another flight to 0.5 hr (i could just make it). They have announced such delayed arrival timeframe at the beginning of the flight, thus it is anticipated. Why can’t they make better calculation when they sell tickets? Thus you may consider allowing more transit time to play safe. 3) Addis ababa airport is simply CHAOTIC. As of today (7 july 2018) the public announcement system does not seem to work, a lot of people don't know which gate to go, a pot of people in the wrong queue, some people miss the flight, simply chaotic. Thus if possible, pl allow more transit time. 4) some flights are very old. Today (7/7/18) i got on a flight with only communal TV, and the food could only be heated to lukewarm. 5) i have ordered special meal and unlike other airlines, they dont record which customer had ordered special meal.

Granted this is not the fault of the airline but most of their flights traverse Addis, so it's an unavoidable part of the experience. Thankfully we did not have to stay more than a couple hours and boarded our lovely dreamliner to Lusaka.

The staff/crew of the airline are absolutely wonderful HOWEVER the plane was EXTREMELY dated, had no in-flight entertainment and ventilation seemed poor. I had sat towards the back of the aircraft and noticed that during the flight, 4 people had passed out (and they were not intoxicated). The plane from Johannesburg to Addis Ababa was extremely old - we do not even use those types of aged planes on our domestic routes in South Africa. The airport at Addis is extremely overcrowded, chaotic and could pose a potential risk to tourists. It is absolutely appalling so be prepared in advance! The return flight from The Seychelles to Addis was cancelled... eventually. No information was provided by the airline and all passengers had to stay overnight at the airport as the staff members had stated that Ethiopian Airlines would not authorise accommodation costs. We had had enough and eventually flew out of Mahe directly to Johannesburg via Air Seychelles which was excellent in standards and service.

Aug,2018.0,Never Again,Washington DC,Entebbe International Economy,"This was our third trip on Ethiopian Airlines, and it will be our last. Each time was worse than the preceding one. We were supposed to have about three hours between flights in Addis Ababa, but the airline changed their schedules so that we had only 65 minutes. This made me nervous, and justifiably so, because we left Dulles an hour late. We were never given an explanation for the delay. We made up no time in the air and arrived in Addis just about when boarding for our flight to Entebbe was supposed to be closing. The airline did something right for a change - they pulled out passengers with connections to Entebbe and Nairobi and put them on busses to take them directly to their flights. But right with this airline is relative, because when we got our plane, the flight was delayed for two hours, so back to the terminal we went. When we finally boarded, it wasn't by rows or sections, it was just a huge crush. We got breakfasts on both flights, and the scrambled eggs were cold both times. On the return flight, we got to Addis only a little late, but getting on to our flight was a horror, because all flights to the US leave from one end of the terminal, and you have to go through security even though you have already gone through security. There is only one line for all the passengers on a Boeing 777, which is a lot of passengers, so by the time we finally got through, boarding was already well along. The flight stopped in Dublin, for some reason (nobody got on or off), and between Dublin and Dulles we got a meal which should have been breakfast, but was more like lunch or dinner. Chicken and rice is not my idea of breakfast, but at least it wasn't cold. Service is spotty at best. Nobody cleans up the restrooms, and when they run out of toilet paper the flight attendants rarely put in new paper even if you tell them about it. We are going to Namibia in a couple of months. Ethiopian was an option for getting there. We are flying South African.",3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor
Aug,2018.0,Horrible Experience with luggage,Entebbe,Dakar Africa Economy,"I have made several attempts to contact Ethiopian Airlines regarding my horrible experience in Senegal regarding my luggage arrival. I arrived on 13 August in Dakar, after suffering a major delay in Entebbe for 2 hours, then another 3 hour delay occurred in Addis, causing us to arrive 2 hours later than planned in Dakar. Upon arrival my suitcase didn’t arrive after waiting for 2 hours. My destination for my trip was to Touba for two weeks to see my family (please see the attached ticket), which is 3 hours away from the airport. I requested for the suitcase (when it arrived at the airport) to be delivered to my house, in response: Ethiopian Airlines does not provide that type of service. I was forced to take a hotel reservation in Dakar (the cheapest hotel I could find online) and only able to get a good deal if I paid for 5 days. In order to travel to and from the hotel, I had to pay for shuttle service. I used the tracking number on the baggage claim form to locate my suitcase for three days. I called Ethiopian airlines multiple times, still no feedback regarding the location of my suitcase. On the early morning of day 4, I took a risk/gamble and begged the receptionist of the hotel to arrange shuttle service to the airport. Fortunately enough, my suitcase was there. Though I was happy, a feeling of disgust overcame me due to the complete disregard Ethiopian Airlines had for my well-being and privacy. I was never notified when the suitcase arrived, and I was informed the suitcase was there for almost 2 days. Upon retrieving the suitcase I contacted the airlines again with my case number (just to see if my pick-up was in the system) the response was the suitcase has not been found yet, I will be notified. I’ve been using Ethiopian Airlines since, September 2017 (sheba miles# 000985527575) and never experienced this behaviour from any airline before. It was a sickening and stressful inconvenience for me since my time is Senegal was very limited. I returned to my duty station of work in Juba, South Sudan and contacted the office, in turn they referred me to the Senegal Office. There has been a lot of back and forth in calling. Due to my health condition and work, I was unable to visit the offices. I will like for Ethiopian airlines to address this issue after seeing the expenses incurred during this trip due to it’s negligence. If it appears the airlines is not willing to admit to their fault, I will like to seek consult from legal and the corporate office on how to move forward. Honestly, I’m very reluctant to use this service to travel to West Africa again, let alone to New York. I await your response.",2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Little did I know the nightmare that was waiting for me when I left my home. Ethiopian Airlines canceled my flight 3 times. Why you ask? because of safety concerns according to them. Now my question for them is why do you allow a flight ticket to be bought 3xxx not once but 3xxx if there are safety concerns??? I booked it they canceled and then whenever they canceled they would give me a ticket that was 2 days out like something would change in 3 days. I had to stay in ADDIS for a week and a half because these people couldn't get their ducks in a row. My phone was stolen and ran out of money due to staying at hotel that they refused to ACCOMMODATE ME FOR. MY ADVICE DON'T TAKE THEM. TAKE ANOTHER AIRLINE.

I have been waiting for a response for 2 months as of now. Even their Twitter account started to ignore me. Very sketchy airline. Food gave the entire family food poisoning. The meat was bad. The AC was completely off, everyone on the plane was boiling and requested AC be turned on multiple times but nothing was done. They had no TVs on any of their international flights - yet their prices were more expensive then other airlines that DO have on flight entertainment. Cleaning crew stole my phone and when proven (using Find My iPhone) the customer service team told me to email them about it another day and then ""wrote a claim"" up for me on the back of a random paper which I am suppose to believe went to management.... I have emailed them once a week since end of August. It is not end of October and I have only gotten 2 responses and no one has assisted me further. I travel internationally twice a month and hardly ever have any trouble with any airline but Ethiopian Airlines has been nothing but a nightmare to work with. I hope I can change at least one persons mind about flying with them because this airline honestly deserves to be shut down. Very dirty aircraft, food is not only horrible but harmful, customer service is terrible and their flight cleaning crew cannot be trusted. HIGHLY RECOMMEND FLYING WITH ANY AIRLINE BUT ETHIOPIAN.

The seats were comfortable and the entertainment options were decent. The reason for 4 stars is because one of our seats on one of our flight legs was not in the best working order (not too much of a big deal), the airport in Ethiopia is a mess (disorderly and run down) and also because we sent a customer inquiry regarding our flights in August, received an automated email and have yet to hear back. Nevertheless, it was an economical flight for Business class and we were able to do all legs of our trip with Star Alliance/United points. Our biggest fear was our bags not getting to and from Africa since we had multiple legs on the trip and thankfully we had no issues. The lounges to which Cloud 9 provided access (Star Alliance and Cloud 9) were good and they helped a great deal during our layovers in Entebbe and Ethiopia.

Aug,2018.0,Pretty solid - pleasantly surprised,Newark,Nosy Be International Economy,"For our large family trip (14 of us) to Madagascar we investigated quiet a few airline options and we went with Ethiopia Airlines. Here's the good: - Ethiopia Airlines had the option to bypass Tana and just go direct to Nosy Be which we preferred - By far the cheaper option by at least $500-$600 per person. With 14 of us that was significant savings - Service was good - pleasant staff and crew - Lots of in-flight entertainment options, movies, games - Because we were in a long flight - total flight time of 21 hours - we had to stay overnight in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The airline takes care of the hotel accommodations and transport. The process was easy and efficient. What needs improvement: - We had a long flight so we actually got to eat 6 total meals on the plain. After the 4th meal - I did not want to eat their chicken and rice meal. Some variety would have improved the experience. - We never took off on time on the any of our flights and always were delayed by at least two hours. - The actual planes are a bit older and could use some revamping.

Aug,2018.0,Unhelpful,Accra,Nairobi Africa Economy,"My husband and I took a return flight from Accra to Nairobi in August. We found the staff to be quite unhelpful. It took 30 mins for any in-flight request (water, blanket, etc) to be responded to let alone fulfilled which was only made worse by the fact that the attendants on my flight were rude. On our way back to Accra we arrived at JKIA in Nairobi in ample time, however, because we used a credit card to purchase our tickets we were required to verify our credit card. We did this in Accra but were not aware we would be required to do it again on the return leg. So we leave the check in line and see the manager. At this point the manager is the only person available to verify the card, which of course meant long wait times. Finally we return to check in and the desk attendant wrongly checks our bag to Addis and not Accra. When we realize the mistake, the bag has just barely gone down the conveyor belt, and in my opinion could have been easily retrieved without inconveniencing other passengers (given we were now very few going through the check in process). Instead she informs us she will change it in the system and that all will be fine. It has been almost a month and our bag is no where to be found. A situation which could have been avoided if the attendant, who could not have been less bothered about her mistake, had simply gone for the bag and changed the tag. The airline has been unhelpful and unsuccessful in locating our luggage giving standard responses such as ""we are tracking your bag"" etc.I have sent a detailed description and picture of the bag. And the airline sent us completely different bag (nothing like i described AND padlocked). This demonstrates either a lack of communication between offices since a picture of my bag should be in the system or carelessness. I understand that this happens. But the poor service from beginning to end ruined the experience for me and made the loss of my bag less accidental and more a result of negligence.",3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

The current airport is basically one long hall with not many places to sit and few places to eat and one or two market-esque stalls where ""tourists"" can but exorbitantly overpriced baubles. Toilets are in container type stalls. 3/4 Lounges for business class / ""Sheba Miles"" upper class cardholders. Hopefully the new construction will upgrade the whole feel of the entire airport.

The information about the delay was poor, to say the least, so many people were angry and yelling at the staff at the gate. Lunch was offered in the lounge. New technical problems occurred when we were finally in the plane after a 6 hours' delay, so it took another two hours before we could leave, arriving 8 hours later that planned in Zanzibar. Throughout this experience the staff was courteous and helpful, though some could use some training in giving information to passengers. On the way back home from Zanzibar we were told the flight was overbooked and we would be put on another flight. We were only told 20 minutes before departure time that we could fly after all, so there was a lot of stressing getting through security and into the plane. There was no delay in Addis this time, but the staff was rude and unhelpful. My husband needed assistance in boarding the plane, we were dumped in a cold waiting hall 2 hours before the flight, just to be put in a bus together with the all the other passengers. We were given seats at the back of the plane, which is quite a long walk for someone who has problems walking. The crew just told us that the plane was full and they would not do anything about our seats, in stead they just gave my husband (who was in pain by then) a third degree about his ability to fly in the first place. The planes were outdated and many features did not work (no sound, in flight entertainment broken, seats did not recline, table was wobbly), so I cant say I would recommend flying with Ethopian Air.

The food was ok, and the leg room wasn't bad. The Bad: The Gate agents managed to screw up our seating on every flight, both on the way there and the way back. I honestly don't understand how it is so difficult for them. Apparently they have no idea what online check-in is or how it works. In Zanzibar, we had to wait so long at the baggage check-in after we had already checked in online and had assigned seats, that we almost missed our flight. I intentionally left 3 hrs between every flight and we used every bit of it, do to their incompetence. The Ugly: Some idiot in the company decided to but a boxing game on the touch screens on the back of the seats. A BOXING GAME! How dumb can you be? Imagine a 13 hr flight with a 4 yr old punching the back of your seat THE ENTIRE TIME! Apathetic parents wouldn't do anything about it either, despite being asked nicely multiple times.

Had to accept No-Show and rebooking fee to ET just outside the airport. Had no visa but transit passed relatively smoothly with a lot of officers leading and attending me while retaining my passport. A humiliating experience but I know these things eventually works out well – just don’t be fuzzy. Ticket reissue went very fast, paid 100 USD cash. Both Boarding passes received in KRT which proved crucially necessary: flight became 45 Min. delayed. Bus-gatings from/to terminals throughout, very tiresome: I waited in KRT >30 Minutes with 80 passengers in a double-bus before it took-off to the aircraft 200 meters away. Transit in ADD was horrible due to hundreds of people waiting and blocking security check. Managed in last Minute to board an old 737-700 to Kigali. However, after boarding delayed >1 hour on tarmac due to “gas refuelling” discovered through the captains’ recalculation of amount needed.

We were traveling from Nairobi to Muscat and the Nairobi flight delayed for more than 2.5 ihours resulted in missing the onward flight to Muscat. The funny fact was that the Captain did announce that the Muscat flight was waiting for us, and an ET staff separated those traveling to Muscat from the rest and got us in a bus. But alas, no one was there to guide us once we reached the terminal and after running here and there, we were informed that the Muscat flight left. They gave us no option other than to take the lousy hotel they offered for a day stay with 3 meals along with a transit visa. We had to spend an whole 24 hours without any clothes to change. They were 5 unaccompanied minors with us along with an old man who was diabetics. Later on we came to know that Muscat flight was left without us even though it was possible to accommodate us, only because it was overbooked!!! From the hotel staff, it has come to know that they dealt almost 100-200 passengers daily in the same situation from Ethiopian Airlines. On the top of all these, when we checked in next day, one of our seat got upgraded to Business class as they already issued the same seat to someone else and they were many other similar cases in our flight.. took more than 30 min for the staff to sort out the seating issues resulting in the delay of take off..",2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Aug,2018.0,The airline is fine but Bole airport is not much fun,Cape Town Central,London International Economy,"Ethiopian have carved out a very successful market for travel around Africa and also from Africa onwards to the rest of the world at pretty reasonable prices. As a result the airline has grown fast and become the largest on the continent. On the whole flying with Ethiopian is a pretty decent experience although the food is rather unexciting. They have a pretty good in flight entertainment movie choice and the staff are friendly enough. They have a large number of new planes which are well equipped but also some pretty old ones are still flying mostly within Africa which are rather less enjoyable to be in - but flying within Africa is rarely a huge pleasure. Given their business model they have a huge transit operation at Bole Airport in Addis and the place seems to be crowded night and day with passengers moving around the world. However the airport itself although fairly new is pretty disorganised and unpleasant. In particular the toilets are pretty nasty and due to poor planning at the design stage of the airport, insufficient for the number of passengers using the main terminal so there are some 'temporary' toilets around as well which seem rather flimsy. All passengers including transit passengers have to queue up for security check near the gate before boarding their flights after which at peak times causes large queues at the check points which are situated at either end of the departures lounge and also half way along and a further check point for premium passengers. If the queue closest to your boarding gate is very long it is sometimes worth trying the a different point although the connecting door after security between the gates at one end of the terminal and those at the other can sometimes be closed (it seems to open and close quite randomly) in which case this plan won't work. As many connections involve an overnight stay in Addis the airline provides complementary hotel accommodation in town and will provide a hotel voucher which also serves as a transit visa document. After passing through passport control (long queues) and customs the airline has a transit hotel desk where your voucher needs to be stamped and then you find you way to the transit minibus for your particular hotel outside the main entrance. The hotels used are all pretty similar and basic but ok for a one night stop over. You will also get a free but simple meal at the hotel and breakfast if your flight is not early the next day (neither meal is really worth having unless you are very hungry). Ethiopian is building its own huge transit hotel near the airport which may mean a slightly improved experience in the future although there seems to be a rather uninspiring consensus in Ethiopia on what a good hotel is like (boring and plain and a bit tatty). If you have a Star Alliance Gold card (or something which looks like one) you can avoid the queues for immigration and security. The gold lounge for those with access is a break from the crowds and general chaos in the departure lounge which is full of tatty shops and a few places to eat. However on my last visit between clearing breakfast at 10 and putting out lunch at 12 there was nothing to eat which seemed rather strange. The lounge itself is rather uninspired but nicer than outside in terms of seating a toilets.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Aug,2018.0,My Worst Flying Experience,Kigali,Toronto International Business Class,"We were supposed to travel from Kigali to Toronto via one transfer at Addis Ababa on August 13, 2018. Our flight on August 13 from Kigali was delayed for more than five hours due to various reasons (inefficient ground crew, inferior equipment such as broken chairs, etc.). The ground crew at Kigali even lied to us regarding the status of our flight saying that it was on the way. However after checking the flight status on flightradar24, it was confirmed that the plane had not even taken off Bujumbura. In fact the plane was on Bujumbura for more than 2.5 hours prior to flying to Kigali. Again in Kigali, it took them 1.5 hours to turn the plane around with only additional passengers. The ground crew at Kigali was totally inefficient. Due to the extended delay, we missed our direct flight to Toronto, which left the gate approximately 30 minutes prior to our arrival at Addis. We have been delayed before via other airlines, but most of the time, the airlines would hold the international flights to accommodate. However this is not the case for Ethiopian Airlines, they simply do not care about their customers. The transfer desk was a total chaos, because so many passengers missed their flights. It was past midnight at that point. We were eventually directed to take tomorrow flight to Toronto via Chicago O'Hare, as Ethiopian does not fly to Toronto on Tuesday. We were told by the transfer agent that our luggage would accompany us to O'Hare. We were provided with transit visa and hotel vouchers. The trip to the hotel was exhausting. The hotel reception at Hilton was terrible. In the outset, the receptionist sent us to an inferior room filled with stale cigarette smoke, even the room was clearly marked non smoking. He even insisted on charging us for internet because he said the hotel vouchers did not include the use of internet. We were basically being penalized for missing our connection. To no fault of our own, we needed to pay for internet to rework our work schedule. After emailing to the VP customer service Mr. Yared, we are still waiting for the refund. After spending one very unproductive day in Addis, we finally arrived at Bole International Airport at around 7:30pm to check in our flight to O'Hare. The check-in clerk at the counter again confirmed that the bags would be with us after glancing at the first luggage tag. After arriving at O'Hare, we were told that we needed to collect our check-in luggage and clear US customs. We waited more than 45 minutes, and our priority luggage was no where to be seen. Anyway the ground crew at O'Hare told us that we had to report the missing bags once we landed at Toronto via Air Canada, their star alliance partner. Dealing with Air Canada was a pleasure as compared to Ethiopian Airlines. Anyway we have written to the VP as mentioned with copies to the CEO, we are still waiting for our lost luggage, reimbursement for out of pocket expense, and compensation for two days missed work. We would not be holding our breath. This would be the last time we fly Ethiopian Airlines.",2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor
Aug,2018.0,The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER,Bologna,Johannesburg International Economy,"Ethiopian airlines is the worst flight company I ever experienced in my life, I do not even think it deserves to be called flight company ..NIGHTMARE COMPANY would be more appropriate as definition for them! My journey foresaw 2 stopovers, the first in Rome and as soon as I landed I learnt that the flight had been postoponed by 3 hours, that became 4, the aircraft made the passenger waiting before the take off for other 45minutes, no A/C on board before the take off and it was unbelivably hot. Due to this delay, I missed the flight I was expected to catch in Addis Abeba. I received the worst treatment ever at the Ethiopian desk in Addis Abeba, I explained that due to this delay I could not use the hotel already booked and paid in Johannesburg, and I needed a refund for this, since my arrival at the destination was expected to be on the 10th but due to the delay I would have arrived instead on the 11th. At the Ethiopian desk I was said that no refund would have been given to me. The aicraft transporting passengers from Addis Abeba to Johannesburg seemed to be very unsafe, the helic made a strong and creepy noise. Finally I landed safe and sound at destination and my flight expected to last 13h hours actually lasted 24hrs! Unbelievable..what is worst is that I got my luggage lost, I was able to have it returned only after 2 days but no assistance was given to me by the flight company, nor refund. Indeed it was the lost and found office in Johannesburg that assisted me and helped me to have the luggage returned. Now it is 5 days I am struggling to reach Ethiopian airlines by email, and even if I wrote at least 3 emails nobody never replied, I was said I was entitled to receive 75USD as refund and I am still waiting for somebody explaining me how to get the refund!!!

I have traveled to more than 14 countries with more than 10 airlines but none could beat the horrible experience of Ethiopia airline. The ordeal is not finished yet and I am still waiting at Addis Ababa to go to Dubai. The problem started when flight at Blantyre was delayed by 3 hours. The worst, the booking clerk issued boarding pass till Addis Ababa and told me to collect boarding pass of dubai at Addis Ababa airport. I believed and it was my biggest mistake. Now I came to Addis Ababa and after continuous follow up with the person concern i could not get boarding pass. They asked me to wait for some time and checked 80% passanger and then declared flight is full and next flight is in morning. It is to be noted that my flight was at 9.35 pm from Addis Ababa which got delayed to 1 am and after it was declared full, next flight announced was at 10.00 am in morning. There were around 25 passenger stranded without their fault infact it was fault of Ethiopian airlines. After a lot of fight, struggle and waiting at 3 am new ticket is issued and we are left at low class lounge at our mercy to wait till 9.45 pm ( promised to provide hotel but it is certain no such facility will be given because there are more than 500 people stranded for different flight because of overbooking and nobody is there to console or give appropriate reply.

What a disappointment when the food of the nation eat airline represents is so good. I think I may even have gotten sick from the food. Sadly the service was not much better. There were maybe 2 of the cabin stewards that were pleasant, whereas for the rest it seemed like an imposition to be there and to have to provide service to people. We are paying for the service after all - the travel is not free! Ethiopian, I would recommend that instead of just adding routes , you up your game and make Africa proud.

Checked in online after some difficulties, but was allowed to transit 7 hours prior to departure. Granted 3rd part lounge in Dar is Tanzanite which always gives me problems when entering. Always greedy after money and this time they wanted to charge me 35 USD because I was “2 hours early”. This, despite I had Lounge Invitation printed on my BPs. I had to call ET-manager to access. The lounge is so, so, but they have plenty hot snacks and drinks. Aircraft B787-900 on 1st leg was downgraded to a smaller B737 due to low load in economy. However, that caused 3 biz-passengers to be downgraded. Without being requested, I volunteered to do so and got 250 USD in ET-vouchers as compensation. The check-in staff came to the lounge and were relieved by my decision. I was fine as I still had my special meal and lounge access. I was treated like a king to Addis: despite travelling economy I almost felt ashamed getting champagne and foods from bz-class brought down discretely to row 17. I even got my special meal (red-snapper) but had to additional dishes, veal and beef, all very tasty. Got the menu from business could choose food and drinks from there. Only downturn was the plastic cutlery. They gave me 3 seats for myself despite economy became 75% full. Cloud Nine Lounge in Addis was OK but no showers neither there not in any other lounge in Addis. Tried to cash my vouchers but failed. Both flights almost on time.

Aug,2018.0,TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL. WILL NEVER FLY THEM AGAIN.,Addis Ababa,Kilimanjaro National Park Africa Economy,"Although our boarding pass showed our seat assignments as 11 J, L for our flight from Addis Ababa to Kilimanjaro, when we tried to board, we were told without any further explanation that our seats had been reassigned. They sent us to another agent who then reassigned us to two seats in Row 24. . When we booked our flight at least 8 months ago, we literally were the first people to select our economy seats and we chose 11 J, L because I am 6’4” tall and these seats would provide me the best available leg room, plus it placed us next to the exit row so that we would be at the head of the line for visa and passport processing. Sitting in row 24 was completely inferior in both regards. The Ethiopian Air staff did not offer any apology until I protested and wanted to know why the change was being made. They only said that the change was necessary due to a last-minute change in aircraft. I knew this to be a lie because, I had found that my wife’s seat assignment had been removed at least a week prior. After checking with Ethiopian Air and our agent with Holbrook Travel, I was assured me that our seat assignments were fine After I protested, they allowed me to move from my Row 11 aisle assignment to my wife’s window assignment, but they still reassigned my wife to row 24, which slowed her when she deplaned. Instead of being at the head of the lines for visa and passports, we stood in lines for over two hours, forcing other Road Scholar passengers and our tour guide to wait on us for over 1.5 hours. After talking with the passenger who was then assigned to my wife’s seat, it became clear that Business Class had been overbooked, he had lost his Business Class seat and was given my wife’s seat as compensation. My wife and I travel extensively and we have never before received such poor and unprofessional service from any airline. The unapologetic behavior of the staff, their attempt to lie telling me this was a very last minute change, not disclosing this problem to us until the very moment we were to board the plane, , and the fact that they considered my wife to be “less deserving” of her seat assignment than someone who had been moved from Business Class were all totally unacceptable actions, each of which should have been handled in a much different and more professional manner. Because it was not, my wife and I were placed in a very embarrassing and humiliating situation that was entirely avoidable. We had other options for our travel on this trip, but we chose Ethiopian Air on the recommendation of our travel agent. I will not fly with EA again.",3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Their service is good, flight attendants friendly, and aircraft pretty good. When leaving from Addis they have the ""seat zone"" loading approach figured out pretty well. They load from the back of the plane and it works well. When flights originate in other cities, it's a bit dicier approach. This week, we flew from Joburg back to Addis. When it comes time to load, they ask all the passengers to leave the boarding area and file back out to the hallway. They then, using no microphone or public address system, ask passengers to board by rows (i.e., rows 30 and higher, rows 20 and higher, rows 15 and higher, etc.). They don't make friends with this approach. People are crabby to get up and leave their seats in the waiting area, and they are angry when they can't hear. It would be much better if they just rope off the boarding area until they are ready to load the plane, and also if they would use a microphone to help load the plane.

Also the service during the flights is, in comparison with many other airlines, to be considered very good, no complain. However, the often times cumbersome security checks in both 'Bole'-terminals, twice in each location (ground- and upper floor), may be a bit of a minus, thus, I always check-in early to avoid queueing and time pressure.

I didn't think they expected me to get off the plane, onto a bus to the terminal, get through security and board my next flight in 20 minutes. Clearly this is impossible! Having missed my connection, they offered to put me on the same flight 24 hours later, which I declined. Only by standing for nearly three hours at the overwhelmed Transfers desk, appealing to three different people (the first two said there was no alternative) I was given a seat on an Air Egypt flight 6 hours later.

Sep,2018.0,A very poor experience,Antananarivo,London International Economy,"This flight ET852 was to Addis Ababa and connecting to flight ET700 to London. At check in we were informed that the flight was going via Entebbe in Kenya to refuel and drop off passengers and to pick up new ones. Total disorganisation as we were booked onto seats in rows 16 and 28. As a couple on a long haul flight this was unacceptable. After referring to someone in authority we were eventually booked onto seats together. At Entebbe there was a scramble as seated passengers had to move to other vacant seats to allow embarking passengers to take up their seats. What chaos, the flight staff could not cope. What if there had been a technical fault with the aircraft, we did not have visas for Kenya. We would have been herded into internal airport rooms until a flight was available. I do not think this would have been a pleasant experience. Fortunately the aircraft took off on time!! During the connecting flight to London, toilets had run out of toilet paper, one sink was left to overflow and there was very little cabin service to provide adequate drinks of water. The touch screen entertainment on one seat did not function, we shared one set of headphones to view one screen, limiting our viewing options. We were greeted with the magazine rack behind one seat being left with litter and empty cans of drink. On landing, cabin staff did not enforce passengers to have their seats in the upright position and we noticed one couple who did not have their food trays cleared away and had to land with the tray table left out. All of which is against airline safety!!! Ethiopean Airlines is using Addis Ababa as a gateway hub to all of Africa. This airport is undergoing a major refit. The toilets are very basic, although there was an attempt to keeping them clean. I think this airport will be worth a visit in a few years time, but is not very welcoming at the moment.",2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,TripAdvisor
Sep,2018.0,Women Beware: Worst In-flight experience,Addis Ababa,Toronto International Economy,"Ethiopian Air: Worst in-flight experience - Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET502 Sept. 22 from Addis to Toronto via Dublin. It is a 16-hour night flight when you consider the 1.5-hour refuelling in Dublin along the way. I had decided to try to sleep as much as possible in order to be able to function at my work when I arrived in Toronto. That meant deliberately booking a window seat, 22A. The flight was a bit late leaving, making it approximately 11:30pm before we were in the air. I put on the eye-shades and noise cancellation headphones and leaned on the window. No-one would interrupt my sleep in order to use the toilet, or that was my thinking at least. My travel companions 22B and 22C were engaged in a discussion: 22B was an older Somalian man, he tapped my arm to wake me. He gestured that he had a headache and asked whether I had a painkiller. I did not have painkillers but the woman in 22C gave him an Advil. He proceeded to snap his fingers and wave his hands to gain the attention of the stewardesses who were preparing for take-off. He managed to get immediate attention for a glass of water to help wash down the painkiller. I resettled into the window, only to have this man jab my arm repeatedly over the next hour. He fidgeted restlessly, tossing this way and that. He had claimed both arm rests for his own use but that wasn’t enough and started to spill over to my space. I would just start to fall asleep and he would jab my arm with his arm as he fidgeted about. I asked him to please be considerate, that I was trying to sleep, and pointed to the natural boundaries of the armrest. But it didn’t stop. After about an hour the woman in 22C could no longer tolerate the man’s fidgeting and asked the stewardess to move her. I took the opportunity of this disruption to use the washroom facilities, but on my return I found this man stretched out over all three seats. I asked him politely three times to move but he waved me dismissively away and continued to occupy the entire 22A -22C row, including my seat. I called a stewardess who, after a few attempts, managed to get him to reluctantly move enough so that there was space for me – he took possession of my seat 22A and had his feet curled up on 22B. He refused to give me my bag and my shoes; I had to grope around to retrieve them, and I had to move his shoes from under the 22C seat – he already had claimed that space as his own. I was annoyed that I lost the window seat and missed the opportunity for catching some sleep but decided to take it with good grace. Unfortunately this man continued to disturb me. He leaned his feet right up against my thigh and pushed so that I was squeezed into as small space as possible. I repeatedly asked him to stop and pushed his feet away from my legs. I asked the stewardesses to intervene but he continued his behaviour as soon as they were gone. He put his feet in my lap at one point, at which I pushed him away. He swung up and glared at me and I realized that this was not going to end well. I went to the stewardesses and asked that something be done about this man. “What can we do?” was the answer I received. What they could have done was move the man as soon as he was behaving badly and before all the other passengers had settled into sleep. What they could have done was insist that he move out of my assigned window seat and move to the now vacated aisle seat 22C. What they could have done was move me into a business class seat so that I could get some peace from this inconsiderate passenger. What they could have done is move this man to another seat in order that he could no longer disturb my flight experience. What they did was find a spot for me between two sleeping passengers. Lets do the math here. The man wanted all 3 seats and behaved so badly that he eventually got his way. He slept like a baby on all three seats. The passenger of 22C no longer had an aisle seat, she was wedged between two other passengers. I no longer had a window seat. I was wedged between two passengers who had already settled into sleep, disturbing them as I resettled. I have travelled with Ethiopian Air since 1985. This experience has tainted my otherwise positive impression of the airline. Surely your in-flight staff have training in dealing with difficult passengers? Surely the decision should be to move the disturber rather than those passengers that have been disturbed? I have no doubt that if the stewardesses had placed this man beside the tall, bulky Ethiopian man I eventually sat beside, he would have been forced to behave himself. The in-flight staff were ineffectual and my passenger rights were infringed upon. Ethiopian Airlines, you need to manage unruly passengers a whole lot better than you do.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

As the plane taxied for take-off, she was on her cell phone talking, and when I pointed this out to a flight attendant that happened to be sitting near by, the flight attendant's reply was a nonchalant ""we're getting ready to take off."" Example two: During the flight from Addis Ababa to Seoul, with the flight being so long, I would get up to stretch, walk, etc. During my walks to the galley, I noticed several flight attendants propped up against bulkheads sleeping. I thought that was extremely unprofessional.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Sep,2018.0,Nice bed!,Washington DC,Nairobi International Business Class,"I was surprised to find that Ethiopian is the largest African airline and has a relatively young fleet. While the actual seat was a bit out of date, and several of the buttons did nothing, it was huge (by comparison to LH, UA, BA, etc.) At 6'3"" I could actually stretch out and sleep. Also, the bed was full-width at the bottom (my feet were not jammed into a tiny cubbyhole). The service was adequate but the food was dreadful (both the Ethiopian and western). Note that they really try to serve passengers bot a full Ethiopian and western entree. But then I don't fly for the food. The beer was cold and the Johnnie Walker Black was free-flowing, so I was happy. The lounge at ADD was adequate, but the lounge at NBO was a disgrace (use the Turkish Airline lounge instead).

Sep,2018.0,Biz class is so roomy - even the footrests seemed spacious.,Addis Ababa,Abidjan Africa Business Class,"The best thing about most Ethiopian biz class flights is a full flat bed seat. But what stood out on this flight was my spotting two other biz class passengers, sat on the padded foot rests next to the bulkhead in front of their seats - the set next to each other, having a casual conversation before take off...and they actually looked comfortable. I swear it could have been a living photograph from an airline catalog. Of course, I found a way to introduce myself to them and find out if they were over 5'2"". They were! That, is how spacious these seats are. If there was anything negative to say, there's actually two items: 1. The movie selection for this flight was a bit lame. Instead of the usual categories of different film genres, on this flight, there was just one rotating list of a few dozen movies (most, I hadn't heard of). 2. I don't understand why the Ethiopian Airlines safety video has women dancing in swimming outfits while demonstrating emergency floatation device use at the airline's training facility pool (presumably functional for training, not a recreational pool). What, no male flight crew in Speedos to join them? #GenderEquality #Stereotypes",2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,TripAdvisor
Sep,2018.0,No regard for customer service,Nairobi,Johannesburg Africa Economy,"THE most indifferent airline I have flown with absolutely no concern for its customers. I had to change a return flight while visiting family as my mum was rushed to hospital for a medical emergency. Probably the only airline that I have come across that would not grant leniency in fare changes on medical grounds even though we offered to provide evidence. My sister who flew Qatar was able to change her flight at a nominal charge. In any case I had no choice but to change my flight which was then ticketed a day before my original departure date and I went to make the payment at the airport office in Nairobi. Their systems were down and the attendant was unable to access the system. With no other alternative offered by Ethiopian (they couldn’t access any booking) and having waited over 45mins, I was told to check the following day. Called into the office the next day and ET confirmed as long as I made payment before flying my booking would be valid and the charge would be the same. Imagine my surprise when they then charged me an additional $50 for a no show even thought they had changed my flight the day before I flew and it was their system failure that had prevented me from making the payment. Tried to explain to the Nairobi reservations office disclosing all the names of the staff to substantiate my situation but seems like their problem resolution strategy is to frustrate their customers by placing their calls on hold endlessly time and time again. Terrible experience and will never fly them again. Pay the extra bucks for a better airline for peace of mind.",1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,TripAdvisor

It took 6 times asking for a blanket, and even the person next to me got up and approached the attendants lack of service for my blanket request. If you need water they will direct you to get up and go get it yourself. Economy class has become nothing less than corralling cattle to the place and offering the scheduled meal that most often resembles a sponge with rice or noodles. The ADD airport has been in remodeling mode for at least the last eight years I’ve used this route and is always an adventure navigating the gate changes and hour or more standing in line to go through security.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Sep,2018.0,UPDATE: WORST AIRLINE EVER,Cape Town Central,San Francisco International Business Class,"Here's an update to my earlier review. The saga continues... After getting stuck in Addis Ababa overnight due to Ethiopian Air's internal screw ups (see the 7 critical mistakes they made on my previous review), we showed up the next night to check in to our re-booked flights. The incompetence continued: 8) at the last minute they changed our flights (again) leaving on a later flight via Frankfurt, 9) we were given $600 vouchers for our inconvenience. We told them we would never fly Ethiopian Air again, but were assured several times by the Customer Service Mgr on duty (Biruk D) that we could redeem the vouchers for cash at any Ethiopian Air ticket counter. This was (another) misrepresentation to push off off to someone else because when I called the US Customer Service office they told us once the vouchers are issued they cannot be redeemed for cash - that needed to be done at time of issue in Addis Ababa - but instead we would have to use them to fly Ethiopian Air again, 10) then it went from ridiculous to surreal... after they started the boarding process and the entire flight was lined up in the jetway to enter the plane they discovered that no one had the right key to open the doorway at the end of the jetway into the aircraft. So we sat there with a couple hundred other passengers crammed into the jetway waiting for someone to arrive with the key. Several people came and went but no one could find the right key, even though we could see that the pilot and crew had already boarded and were waiting hopelessly on the other side of the locked gate on the plane. Finally after 40 minutes a couple people from maintenance came and hacked off the lock in one of the most dangerous hack jobs I've ever seen. Some people were begging the mgr to stop it in fear for the maintenance peoples safety. Some people were filming it while the Cust Svc Mgr frantically tried to block their iPhones. They finally got it off. 11) over an hour later we finally pulled away from the terminal only to hear a loud thump. Sounded like we ran over something (maybe a block left to chock up the tires? - hopefully not a person). So sure enough, we had to pull back into the gate. They announced over the loudspeaker that someone on the plane was sick, but I saw no evidence of that. We finally departed over 2 hours late, 12) to top it all off - even though we were assured that our bags would be rerouted to SFO on the new flights - that never happened. I filed a lost luggage claim but to date the bags are nowhere to be found.

I said to myself recalling my past nightmares with inland travel on ET in the past. I applaud Ethiopia for keeping things moving in a difficult environment but my last trip left me underwhelmed. I arrived at about 9.00 pm but only managed to clear through immigration past 11.00 pm! Only the parents with really young children braving the winding queue made me think ""It could have been worse!"" Armed with my past experience, I was determined to get things right...confirm my return flight ASAP...I shouldn't have bothered. I was checked in...only to get turned away at the boarding gate. The flight was overbooked and I was to be collateral damage! After more than two hours waiting to be allocated a hotel where I would have to wait till late afternoon for the next flight, I had to stand in a long immigration queue...again. Along with some other unfortunate Africans (I also noticed that most of those bumped off the ET flights were African ...coincidence maybe) we were driven to Afarensis Hotel whose staff acted like they were doing us a big favour, serving us an excuse of a lunch before we could head back to the airport. The airline linking its clients to such poorly managed establishments says something about them. I will not say ""never again"" but given other options, I will take them over Ethiopian Airlines which I can recommend for those who have a lot of time on their hands.

I thought I’d give Ethiopian a try since they were significantly cheaper. THE GOOD: cheap and pretty nice planes THE BAD: 1) several months after we booked our flight they decided to cancel one of our flights and never notified us. Luckily I checked on the status a couple months in advance & found out about it, but 2) trying to get anything done online like rebooking flights, getting seat assignments, etc. is very frustrating 3) talking to the online customer service reps was not much better. No one really had much information, nor did they really seem to care to help. 4) when they rebooked our flights (due to their cancellation) they rebooked us with a very tight connection in Addis Ababa. I should have known better but I was assured by 3 different customer service agents including a supervisor and manager that it would be no problem because they would hold the flight to Washington DC since we were coming in from Cape Town. 5). they didn’t hold the flight. We sprinted through the airport and made it to the gate just as they closed the doors - you’d think they would have known there were people on the connecting flight and would have held it for 15 min. there were at least 15 other people who also got stranded. 6) rebooking at the airport was a joke. It took us 2 over hours to rebook The computers kept going down. Nobody knew what was going on. Agents kept leaving their stations to go chit-chat to one onother. Noone helped show us where to go. 7) so we were stranded in Ethiopia. They put us up in a decent hotel, but we had to drive another 1/2 hour to get there through downtown Addis Ababa in the middle of the night with civil riots going on. 8) service and meals on the flight were marginal at best and we flew Business Class OVERALL: an absolute nightmare of an experience.

They offered a light meal (pasta salad, rice with chicken and custard) which included alcohol beverages (red/white wine and Ethiopian beers). The entertainment system which included a large lcd screen for each seat offered a wide selection of movies and TV shows. I loved the ones that showed around Ethiopia and its landmarks.

There was no proper communication from the Ethiopian Airline staff regarding the delay of the boarding time and no proper handling procedure of the crowd. And the electronic sign-board of the boarding gate just changed to other schedule flight number and time eventhough the queue of the previous scheduled flight was not cleared yet, and I believed this was the reason other passengers who came in later just joint the queue after seeing the display of the electronic sign board.

Sep,2018.0,Worst Airline and customer ever,Los Angeles,Dublin International Economy,"Where do I start probably on hold which is were I spent most of my time. We booked a flight to leave on August 29th. Ticket said 29th, boarding pass had the 29th on it twice and that we were boarding at 11:45 and right below that it said 29th. Turns out that the flight leaves at 00.30 on the 29th so boarding was 28th. No mention of this anywhere. So lets start with that, I will take responsibility. No one in the airport when we arrived, all the numbers on the website are only taking messages. One number had me on hold for an hour, then I finally got through to a number in Ethiopia and spent an hour on the phone. I was on hold for 20 minutes before I got an answer. Spoke to one rep who said it was my fault and the next flight was in two days and it would cost me $1,500 for the three tickets. I asked for a supervisor to see if they would help me out and waive the change fee all he did was recite the policy and to let me know he could not help. I asked for his boss and he said the same and hung up on me. I called the number again on my drive back to San Diego, spent another two hours on hold with no answer. Called the following morning, on hold for two hours so I hung up. Got a number for DC so I called and after one hour someone picked up. Told me should couldn't do anything and when I asked for her supervisor, her response was I asked and he said he couldn't help. $1,300 was the best she could do, she gave me the cell of the Ethiopian manager in LAX and her extension so I could call back and book if that is what I wanted to do. I called the LA manager and left her a message, she texted me back that she couldn't take the call and to leave a message and she would call me back. I texted her back to let her know that I needed to speak about my flight issues and she responded that she couldn't take my call and I should call the ticket office which I did and of course I was on hold again. I needed to take care of flights so I called the DC office back and of course I was back on hold. Left messages for the lady I spoke to that morning and spoke to someone else in her office who said she couldn't help me and that I would have to wait for a call back which finally came at 4pm after In started my calls at 7am. I had to scan in a form and a picture of my Credit card and pay $1,297 to change my ticket. We went to the airport and I made it a point to find Sasi the Manager who while giving me some sympathy about the poor service didn't really care. She said that anyone could have waived the fee if they wanted. I asked her if she could waive the fee or part of it and she said maybe she can do something if I fly with them again. No offer of an upgrade for my family as I wasn't flying with them. No refund, she didn't even want to take my information. As far as the flight, terrible food rude staff who woke my kids up for every part of the service. People kicking their seats on both flights and when they asked them to stop it got worse. They asked the staff to help and they didn't even ask the other people. Never again and I am still to get a response from Sasi about my concerns.",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,TripAdvisor
Sep,2018.0,Cancelled Flight,Buenos Aires,Addis Ababa International Economy,"Booked a return trip from Singapore to Buenos Aires and have to change flights at Addis Ababa. The prices were quite cheap so we decided to try this airline. Prices were different booking on computer and the phone app for the same date. I booked on the app because it was $100 cheaper?? Strange. Once you booked they allow you to select seats without charge, but it was not guaranteed. We had to re-select seats so many times because our selection was always removed. It is quite impossible to get exactly what you wanted. They should just remove the option and charge seats instead to make it easier for passengers. Flight SIN-ADD and ADD-EZE was fine. It was our flight back home, EZE-ADD that was cancelled without prior notice. We were already in the car and almost reaching Ezeiza Airport when our driver informed that the flight has been cancelled. I even did online check in 5 hours prior. No emails, no calls. When we reached airport, there was a short line of people waiting to ask questions about the flight. They told us it was cancelled due to technical problems. We were given a hotel stay in the Hotel Presidente (an old dated hotel) to stay in and fly the next day. No one was pleased. The next day we came back to the airport and there was a very long line. People from the cancelled flight and those who were supposed to fly that very day. After queueing for more than an hour, we were told that we were transferred to another airline! Why can’t they just tell us in advance? They took our mobile numbers and email. They could just tell us by email so that we don’t have to waste time queueing twice. They seriously have to look into managing things properly. Honestly I do not believe it was due to technical issues. You see, there was less than 50 people on the flight that was cancelled. I’m sure they did it deliberately. Many review of this airline is negative. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AIRLINE.",5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

The only disappointment was that the seat definitely did not recline flat to 180degrees!! Not sure but it maybe went to 165? The seats are also pretty dated, and could really use a recovering. There also was only one toilet for the business class cabin of about 25ppl. It was not the cleanliest by the end of the flight, because of overuse.

The flight out of Toronto was okay; however, the return flight was trying. This airline does not seem to enforce any regulations regarding carry on baggage. Consequently, people were hauling in suitcases, duffel bags and really anything except live animals and then trying to jam it all in the overhead bins. This resulted in bins dropping open during flight and stuff falling out. The food served was mostly inedible and repetitious. Over a 12 hour flight, the same dinner was served twice and with odd combinations - pasta with meat chunks with a side of more pasta? At least the flight attendants are generous with the wine and beer to keep passengers happy (or asleep). The cabins in the planes were shabby - torn upholstery, detached mouldings and multiple stains on the carpets. Hope the engine and avionics maintenance is more comprehensive. I give this airline an ""average"" rating because it gets you there safely but not in physical comfort. Seating quality is acceptable though some seat back screens did not work and some fold down trays were broken. The flight attendants are friendly although stoic (and prefer snacking on the meals from first class, not economy). The flights were on time more or less but I question one pilot's decision to land during a lightening storm on approach to Addis Ababa.

On arriving in ADD, I was directed to customer service who upon checking my passport and permanent residence card (PR) said that they need to verify with the embassy and i should have a seat as i wait. 45 minutes later (while the lady assisted all other passengers) I stood up to ask her what was going on. She then gave me back my documents without any explanation and asked me to proceed to the gate. At the gate I explained I didnt have a boarding pass and another lady asked me to seat so that she can process my documents. 2 hrs later,and after the call to board I stood up to ask them what was going on. The lady referred me to another person who then told me their system was down. After pleading that I would miss my flight I was given a boarding pass with a different seat number almost at the end. At first I sat patiently both times as I thought maybe something was wrong with my documents. Turns out it was their system all along and instead of communicating with me they were just indifferent to my plight. I wouldn't recommend this airline to any of my friends after what i went through.

HQ call center has no ideas when and if their flights depart or what is the actual situation. Nobody dares to take the responsibility or show initiative. Seems the ground operations are built up inconsistently and sometimes people make up rules as they go. Very bad management and use of resources. - In Maputo Star Gold Members have limited access to lounge. Staff somehow doesn't know or just doesn't tell customers they could use SAA lounge that works in accordance to Star Alliance rules still. - Star Alliance Gold Lounge in Addis Ababa airport should be closed down, it's crime against travellers.

The Addis stopover is best forgotten. If your stop is more than 2.5 hours best avoid it.Airport is old, insufficient restaurants and toilets are kinda basic. The 2nd leg is horrible. Old tatty plane. Our return leg Jeddah to b Addis we were stuck on the apronfor an hour. No communication on delay, no water, no aircon, just hot stinky plane to deal with.

Oct,2018.0,Pathetic and disgusted!!!!!!!!!,Nairobi,Bahrain International Economy,"Am very disappointed n disgusted by the customer service, from the airport to the ethiopian airlines offices staff!!! I checked in online and as usual, I was there one hour prior to departure . The staff were so slow while others talking on the phone. The lady at the counter killed my time by telling me to go n separate my baggage, upon coming back she tells me that I haven't checked in yet n that I should go to the office at the back of the counter. When I went there the lady I found was so rude n did not take any minute to acknowledge that a customer was there. She kept me waiting for her n without a word, she pointed to the direction of one gentleman, who was to assist me n yet did not as he is the one I gave the screen shots of my check in. He goes n tells the other that she checked in already. But the lady literary refuses that I can't go. So the guy to be kind he tells me that I can fly, but not with my laggage. What is the essence of checking in online? After all this situation he tells me that it's 10 minutes to the departure so I can't go. What kind of service is this? The most annoying part was I asked to talk to the supervisor or manager, I was told that they are on the flight n its closed thus they can't attend to me!!!!!!!!!!!!! Disgust!!!!!!!!! N the only option I have is to pay 200 dollars n take the next flight. Why should I do That? I went to the office hopping to get some help, but still I was told that at the time of the incident there were only 2 staff on ground..... Of which that should not be my business. After I narrated my nasty experience to the gentleman I found in the office, he tells me that I can't get help from there as the supervisor n managers are always busy n can refuse to see the customer, as they have so many meetings to attend n they can't call them for such complaints. He chased us n told us to sit aside he wants to attend to other customers. What kind of service is this? And at the time of the incident I was told that there were only two staff on ground so no one would attend to me.....",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Oct,2018.0,The Chaos at Addis Ababa Airport could put me off using the Airline again.,Addis Ababa,Muscat Governorate International Business Class,"Having the luxury of a designated bus for business passengers to be taken to the airport terminal was working this time for me against me. We were dropped of at terminal 2 and my connecting flight to Muscat was leaving from Terminal 1 - this mean I had to walk against the flow of passengers. The economy class passenger were dropped of at terminal 1 - that logic my dear friends at Ethiopian I don't understand. Terminal 1 is one of those old terminals in Africa of the 1980 the business class lounge is, well nothing to write about but poor!!! Having to board was a mother challenge as only one gate is operational and many African and middle eastern flights depart from there is was most unpleasant and Cloud 9 privileges were not in place here. It took 30 minutes and a lot of tongue biting until I could board the plane. In Johannesburg, when checking in and getting my boarding pass for this leg too, I was informed that I would, once again be the only passenger in business class on that flight. What a bonus I thought - the reality was a nightmare to say the least. When I tried to enter the aircraft 4 cabin crew were crowding the entrance having to ask to pass to get on board. it took a further 20 minutes before I got some water and when asked if there was sparkling wine I was offered, to my horror the wine was warm not chilled at all pointing this out just a shoulder shake that was all. Luckily I was the only one in business class so I could change the seat as mine was a rocking chair! The dinner was uneventful ok and the red wine, a new bottle was opened for me, was super. Ethiopian Airlines, if you guys want to attract business class passengers from other airlines you must avoid this big peak & valley in service and not even attention to detail, just customer service. On this flight the cabin crew's attitude appeared to be that I was a bother to them - that they would have preferred to have no one on the flight. The constant chatting up front did not add charm to the flight. Had this been my first flight with Ethiopian - never again - I will try once more if if this is a flow, you have lost me as a passenger forever so fix it!",1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

On arriving in ADD,i was directed to customer service who upon checking my passport and permanent residence card (PR) said that they need to verify with the embassy and i should have a seat as i wait. 45 minutes late,(while the lady assisted all other passengers) I stood up to ask her what was going on. She then gave me back my documents without any explanation and asked me to proceed to the gate. At the gate i explained i didnt have a boarding pass and another lady asked me to seat so that she can process my documents. 2 hrs later,and after the call to board I stood up to ask them what was going on. The lady referred me to another person who then told me their system was down. After pleading that I would miss my flight i was given a baording pass with a different seat number almost at the end. At first i sat patiently both times as I thought maybe something was wrong with my documents. Turns out it was their system all along and instead of communicating with me they were just indifferent to my plight. I wouldnt recomend this airline to any of my friends after what i went through.

Oct,2018.0,"Reasonable flight experience, but on ground handling needs massive improvement",Sao Paulo,Mumbai International Business Class,"I had to go from Mumbai to Sao Paulo, and the flight options are limited. After much deliberation, I chose Ethiopian Airlines, since it gave me longer time to sleep between Mumbai and Addis Ababa vs. Mumbai to Doha or Dubai. I also did my research to find that the airline was rated 4 Star on Skytrax and also a Star Alliance member - both an assurance of sorts. My onboarding experience in Mumbai was quite pleasant. I met with a senior person from the airline in the Business Class counter. I shared with him that I had thought about flying Ethiopian 10 years back, but did not since they did not have flat beds at that time. He assured me that Ethiopian has undergone a sea change in last 10 years. The flight experience was quite good. The business class is quite spacious. They have indeed revamped their fleet with Dreamliners. The cabin crew was also very responsive and served with a smile. Perhaps the only challenge was lack of understanding of English with some crew members, but that did not come in way of services a lot. The transfer in Addis Ababa was also quite smooth, though the airport is quite crowded and I realised that Addis Ababa perhaps serves as one of the largest hubs in Africa, thanks to growing fleet of Ethiopian (you can see 20-30 Ethiopian Dreamliners parked when you land). My flight to Sao Paulo got diverted to Rio and then reached Sao Paulo. But that was caused by very heavy rains in Sao and had nothing to do with airline. On return, when I web checked-in the previous day, the web check-in information displayed that the flight was delayed (4:50 am instead of 1 am). I was concerned about missing the connecting flight, so I called up the airline office, and was told that connection would still be made. In a way, I was fine since this gave me some time to sleep before taking the flight. When I reached the airport at 2:40 am (terminal 2), I could not locate anyone from Ethiopian there. I asked the Latam team and they told that Ethiopian team had left a couple of hours back and flight had taken off at 1 am!! I had the boarding pass with me that had 4:50 am as departure time. There was no one from Ethiopian at the airport to help on this. And the flight status still showed 4:50 am departure. I was not sure what to do, but resolved that taking Ethiopian again with this experience would be challenging (in spite of a good crew). Ultimately, I got a seat in Air France, which would take me back 14 hours later than planned.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Below standard Business Class product which was somewhat rescued by the very friendly and attentive staff and the excellent food. The return started with an annoyance: we arrived at the airport, again at night, only to learn that our return flight was canceled, reportedly because there were not enough passengers. It must have been a spontaneous decision by Ethiopian since the flight was still displayed on the departure screens. The ground staff was more than nonchalant: “We didn’t call or text you? Oh sorry. Come back tomorrow.” My wife almost lost her composure since we both had to work the next day. With the help of the terminal 1 station manager, we finally managed to be rerouted through Dubai and reached Muscat some six hours later than expected.

Nov,2018.0,such poor service,London,Johannesburg,"London to Johannesburg return via Addis return. I was unable to use the self check in service at home or at Heathrow Airport. It took 45 minutes to check in at Heathrow even though they were only two people ahead of me. They were there making enquiries about flights. I was allocated a middle seat next to the toilets, and I was sitting between two large men. The plane was over booked and some passengers sat with the flight attendants, they were very noisy and were chatting in loud voices with the attendants through out the journey. For the evening meal I was served a tiny roll with melted butter and a filling which was supposedly chicken and a cup of coffee. I was never asked to choose. I do not eat chicken or drink coffee. The flight attendants were not attentive and were very selective in the manner they treated passengers. I was not offered a blanket even though I asked for one several times. On my return I came via Addis on the 25th and arriving at Bole on the 26th of Nov at 5am. On arrival I noticed that I had left my residence card in Johannesburg when I tried to board the flight to London. The check in flight attendant ceased my passport, boarding pass and my baggage stickers. She left me seated at the departure lounge departure lounge until the plane had left. She did not explain what was to happen next but she refused to hand back any of my documents. After two hours she said I must go to the Interlink Desk down stairs and that she would meet me there. I waited for her at the Interlink desk and she never showed up, the staff were not aware of what was happening. They only came to know about my case late afternoon, even then no one could update me or tell me about what was happening. They Interlink staff said they had received my documents from check-in-attendant but they were not going to release my documents. I asked if I could fly back to Johannesburg to try and retrieve my missing document, but I was told I was not allowed to. I spent the day and half the at the airport being ignored. On the 26th late afternoon I was told I was booked on a flight back to Johannesburg. I asked about my luggage and was told the luggage 42kg had been sent to Johannesburg. The staff in Bole refused to hand over my passport but gave it to the flight attendants. When I arrived in Johannesburg I was escorted by two immigration staff off the flight. The immigration staff in Johannesburg handed me back my documents and let me go. I checked for my luggage at the Ethiopian desk, the staff there were not helpful they refused to note that my luggage was missing and advised me to check for it in Heathrow. I booked a direct flight with another airline and I tried to trace my luggage in Heathrow it had not arrived. I luggage remains missing, I have tried to make contact with Ethiopian Airlines in UK through the numbers provided on website and by writing emails to different offices both in UK and Addis both my emails and phone calls have not been answered. I have made several trips to Heathrow trying to make contact and I have been made aware that the desk is only open between 14.15 to 19.15. The phones listed are either in active or are not being answered. Its sad to note that a carrier as big as ET can provide such poor service.",1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

It was fish with lots of cabbage with cabbage pickle. However, The rest was fairly fine. The newly renovated airport in Addis Ababa is partially opened adding extra seats and comfort.

I had a flight going from Addis Ababa to Paris, guy on the counter told me there was a “change in aircraft” & issued me a “standby ticket” but told me there was nothing wrong & seat would be assigned at gate. My baggage was checked, I then proceeded to do security, and asked two more people, told me there was “nothing wrong”, I did the line, waited to hop on the plane, me together with other 5 were on standby. They told me the flight was full, if there was any seat they’d give it to me - they didn’t, instead, they gave it to the other guys that arrived later. I stayed there shocked, and waited & waited, they told me they were going to put me on plane to another city in Europe and then connect me to Paris and issued a ticket for me to go to Geneva - so after one very stressful hour, took me to the office so they’d re-issue a ticket for the next flight (which was in 24 hours) and give me an economic compensation at this point, information was never clear and all agents seemed unprepared. I arrived to the office to find out my “compensation” was 200 dollars for a mistake they did agent again acted rude. They issued me a boarding pass with assigned flight for the next day and gave me a paper to “cash in” the money in “any ticket office of Ethiopian Airlines” literal words from the agent. Next day I came to the Airport, to cash in my money - surprise, they “couldn’t cash money at airport” “they didn’t have dollars” “supervisor couldnt sign the release paper” were some of the various excuses they gave me. They told me to pick up the money at the Hilton Hotel in the city 30 min drive from the airport. I arrived at the hotel, and they didn't have dollars, so....they told me they were going to “try to get the money”. Told me to give them my number and they will call me with a “solution”. I went away, and at 3:50pm they called me to tell me they had the money, that I had until 5pm to get there (another 30-40 minute drive) and get it - rudeness again was present They told me I couldn’t get it at the airport, since no supervisor was available to give me the money, going to the hotel was mandatory. I picked up the ridiculous 200USD, and thought this was the final chapter of this bad Ethiopian movie. I get on the plane the next day at 11:30 pm Sunday (after spending one day in Addis) battling with Ethiopian Airlines, get on the plane, get seated on my seat and another woman with a baby and I had he same seats assigned, and a very rude Ethiopian Airlines agent demanded I moved, since the woman had also this seat.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

Nov,2018.0,Do not expect the truth or any assistance after delayed flights,Victoria Falls,Kilimanjaro National Park Africa Economy,"We flew several times on Ethiopian Air starting in Chicago, then onto Addis Ababa, then to Johannesburg. Then beginning again in Vic Falls thru Addis Ababa onto Kilimanjaro. Then from Kilimanjaro to Zanzibar and then back to Chicago. Despite new equipment which was nice and fortunately our plane did not crash while we were on it --you deplane in Addis by climbing down a two story staircase onto a 100 degree tarmac where you are boarded onto a crushingly overcrowded bus and taken to the airport. There you go through security two times while searching for the location of your continuing flight which is not where they said it would be and no one seems to know where to find it and you have but an hour between flights. The flights seem long for internal African flights, bu that is because they stop at variously one or two- not told to you on your ticket-- other places. You are compelled to sty on the plane while they clean it and somehow are supposed to levitate off the floor when the cleaners come around. Then, there are the delayed flights--your flt. is delayed and you hence miss your connecting flight and it is impossible to get any help rebooking the replacement flight. If you miss--because of their lateness --a flight and have to wait 24 hours for a continuing flight--too bad, so sad--you're on your own for food and lodging. Then another time our flight from Addis to Kilimanjaro via Dar es Salaam was late and they told us us just to get on a flight to Dar and someone will greet us at the gate and see that we get on a continuing flt. to Kilimanjaro where we were to join a safari. more than once in our odyssey through Africa when our flt. was late we were told an agent would be there at the intermediary stop to help us continue our travels. This never happened. When we missed a flight with another airline, they told us they had emailed the other airline so they would rebook us without cost and the station agent laughed at us and said ""they told you that"" and we had to pay again for the missed flight caused by Ethiopian lateness (I mean 8 hours late, this was not a tight connection.....We were bemused when we heard other passengers had made up the same song as had we-""Lie lie lie, lie lie lie lie lie lie lie"" These were attractive capable looking agents who would look you straight in the eye and lie. Addis ababa is a horrid, overcrowded airport, with not flight information--no matter your experience or savvy--Ethiopian Air assumes they are supreme and unfortunately their African passengers accept this. I do not. If they think they are going to take over African flying, they have a long way to go. A brand new airport in which a disabled person has to fight with other passengers to be seated on the shuttle, after fighting to get on the shuttle. A disabled person has to climb up and down a two story stairway carrying their own carry on bag while doing so...and I could go on and on. We ended up on this airline because they are a partner of United and we used miles for this trip.

All of this was okay but the real nature of the airline was to reveal itself when my bag was lost. How this happens on a single leg flight is beyond me and you can guess it was stolen when it arrived at ADD. The follow up assistance was appalling. No calls returned and no one did as they said they would. It was near impossible to get an answer on what was happening when I was there and when I returned to DC. I have had bags in the last 40 years of international travel mishandled (it is a fact of life esp. on multi-leg flights) but having one lost on a single leg is beyond negligent.

Nov,2018.0,Very disappointing experience with customer care,Madrid,Cape Town Central International Economy,"Being a frequent flyer (I fly every week at least once), an aviation and travel markets enthusiast and having recently read so much in both technical and leisure news on Ethiopian Airlines recent achievements in the global market, i decided to give them a try and travel from Europe (Madrid) to Cape Town, via their hub in Ethiopia. Had a flight booked for 3 pax for 28th November which had its schedule changed for the 30th - 2 days of delay!! - just the day before. The company did not notify any of the 3 passengers and we only realized it as we attempted to check in online some 12 hours before. We attempted to get in contact with their Call center many times. Each time we got in contact with an agent, always after waiting some very incredible 45 minutes minimum, if not one hour, we would have to explain that 2 days delays was unbearable and taht e would require alternative coonections, in line with our passenger rights. They would seek to force alternatives within Ethiopian network forcing us around Europe with added delay. when we would ask for an alternative within partner airlines, the agent would accept...but call would always coincidentilly, in that same period, fall. This happened four times in the exact same moment - that when we ask our minimum passenger rights -an alternative with other airlines. In my 4th and last attempt, I even asked the agent to write down my number and call me back if the call would fall. What, not surprisingly, happened again in the moment where I asked for alternative arrangements. Also, not surprisingly, no call back was received even if the agent guaranteed he would be doing it. Having had this serious difficulty, we figured that the only way would be going to the airport at the hour and day we had in our purchased ticket. We were surprised to find no airline agent there and absolutely no one dealing with passengers found in this situation. We again tried some times to reach the Call center and finally got, on our third attempt, a call through with an agent. And, yes, now surprisingly, the connection was not cut in that specific moment where we ask for alternative arrangements being stranded passangers at the airport as we were. The agent was, nonetheless, somewhat surprised that we would request that since our flight had already been planned for 2 days ahead. Its as if the company does not understand the damage it imposes on its clients with 2 days of delay. We were, notwithstanding and after some struggle, able to obtain an alternative connection with Turkish Airlines, Via Istambul, which made us arrive with 24 hours of delay. Needless to say that no hotel arrangement was provided and the agents denied our right to the Eur 600 compensation, imposed by EU law. The agent said that - his words - since we were getting an alternative flight, we were not entitled to a ""refund"", failing to understand the difference between refund and compensation under EU law's obligations of support for stranded passangers. Now in Cape Town, we were, sadly and once again, surprised with a change in our flights back, although this time the company did notify us with 4 days in advance. They decided, out of the blue, to insert a stop in our flight to Madrid in Rome, resulting in a 3hour delay. This wouldn't be that relevant if it wouldn't represent as it does a loss of a indenpendent connection which we had arranged for some comfortable 3 hours after our initial scheduled arrival to Madrid Aware of our rights in cases of schedule changes, I once again attempted to contact the company. I explained them our situation and the agent told us that, since we had already obtained our change initially on our flight to Cape town, changing flight in our journey out of Cape Town would represent a cost to us. We struggled to even show the agent that a) we did not want to change our initial flights, we were forced due to a delay of 2 days and b) again, we are not chaniging our flights back because we want but rather because they decided us to fly us to Rome, something that was not in the ticket we bought, resulting in a very relevant schedule change and delay. The agent understood after some debate and finally he prepared to arrange us alternative connections in alternative airlines. When the connection was cut. We tried a second time, going through the same matter and issue. Guess what? That strange coincidence that the connection falls eactly in the same moment of conversation - when we ask for alternative flights. Honestly, we've given up. We represent that this company will not give us our compensations - as per EU law -, will not reimburse us of our hotel in Madrid which we were forced to pay since the flight was postponned 2 days and will not assume the legal responsability of obtaining us alternative flight when the delay they change their flights to something different of our purchased tickets. I have never been this disappointed with an airline and Im yet to board them for the first time. I fly an average of 80 to 90 flights a year, from the cheapest available Ryanair flight to First Class of Emirates. I have faced all kinds of difficulties in travelling and, better or worse, all companies have established procedures for assistance to stranded passengers. I have travelled more than 100 airlines and, believe it or not, I am not a very demanding passanger. I do represent the operational difficulties and how the industry works, and I do antecipate that problems may happen. Nonetheless, I never felt complete disdain for a client in ANY carrier as I now feel with Ethiopian Airlines. And yes, for those frequent fliers reading my report, yes, they are even worse than the likes of Ryanair in what comes to client care assistance. So, Im really sorry to say this, but if you can, avoid them. At all cost.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

In flight entertainment is poor - my touch screen monitor was hard to operate and my neighbor's did not work at all. Even them, the movie selections are wanting. The main problem with this flight (and the airline in general) is that the check-in staff do not enforce carry-on luggage restrictions. People bring baggage that is way too big (or they bring several medium size bags) and if you are not in zone 1 or 2, you will have a hard time finding overhead compartment space because people in those zones rush in to cram their bags, which means a person seated in row 12 may have to look for overhead space in row 15 or 16. This lethargy of check-in staff delays the boarding process and diminishes the flight's overall experience and the airline's professionalism / image.

Nov,2018.0,"Service is top notch - food, meh!",Dubai,Toronto International Business Class,"This is my second time flying with this airline and I must say they have improved quite a bit. The service is excellent but unfortunately they still have to work on their selection of dining. Many of the options are very spicy or super chewy and/or hard (the meat). My flight from Dubai to Ethiopia was on a brand new Cloud Nine aircraft, the Business class section was super nice. Very comfortable seating with tons of room. The second leg of my trip (Ethiopia to Toronto) was an older plane which was falling apart, fabric coming off of the seats and not the standard I am used to in Business class. Although there was a larger food menu with the option to try Ethiopian delicacies. I love the little amenity kit they give and the array of snacks and beverages available throughout the flight was very good. Ultimately they want to keep you happy but I think they still have a little work to do. Addis Ababa Airport - Ugh!! This airport has not changed at all. They still allow people to smoke and it is too small for the amount of passengers moving through there. They opened a new Cloud Nine Business Lounge, but good luck getting a seat as it is fully packed. I wasn’t overly happy with the food choices or beverages (a small cart with juices and pop).

Nov,2018.0,AVOID Ethiopian Airlines at ALL COSTS! (READ BEFORE BOOKING),Addis Ababa,Paris International Economy,"During my whole experience with ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES I was mistreated, lied to, not enough compensated, flight cost was 800 EUR, and they acted like the most horrible low cost airline, showing no respect/costumer service and inefficiency This is the story of how Ethiopian Airlines (mis)treats its costumers, Saturday night (November 3, 2018) I had a flight going from Addis Ababa to Paris...guy on the counter told me there was a “change in aircraft” & issued me a “standby ticket” but told me there was nothing wrong & seat would be assigned at gate. My baggage was checked, I then proceeded to do security, and asked two more #ethiopianairlines people, told me there was “nothing wrong”, I did the line, waited to hop on the plane, me together w/other 5 were on standby, I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO LET THE AGENT KNOW I WAS WAITING TO BE SEAT-ASSIGNED. They told me the flight was full, if there was any seat they’d give it to ME...they didn’t, instead, they gave it to the other guys that arrived later. I stayed there shocked, and waited & waited, they told me they were going to put me on plane to another city in Europe and then connect me to PARIS...they EVEN ISSUED A TICKET for me to go to Geneva, kept me on hold, BUT NEVER LET ME ON ANY PLANE, so after one very stressful hour, took me to the office so they’d re-issue a ticket for the next flight (which was in 24 hours) and give me an economic compensation at this point, information was never clear and all agents seemed unprepared, all agents were rude and un-helpful, and they kept running “away” without giving me answers. I arrived to the office....to find out my “compensation” was 200 dollars....for a mistake THEY did agent again acted rude. They issued me a BOARDING PASS with an ASSIGNED SEAT for the FOLLOWING DAY (24 hours wait in the city, with the miserable 200 dollars), and gave me a paper to “cash in” the money in “ANY ticket office of ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES” literal words from the agent. Next day....I came to the Airport, to cash in my money.....surprise, they “couldn’t cash money at airport” “they didn’t have dollars” “supervisor couldnt sign the release paper” were some of the various excuses they gave me. They told me to pick up the MONEY at the HILTON HOTEL in the city...30 min drive from the airport...I arrived at the hotel, and guess what? They DIDN’T HAVE DOLLARS, so....they told me they were going to “try to get the money” Told me to give them my number and they will call me with a “solution”....I went away, and at 3:50pm they called me to tell me they had the money, that I had until 5pm to get there (another 30-40 minute drive) and get it...rudeness again was present They told me I couldn’t get it at the airport, since no supervisor was available to give me the money, going to the hotel was MANDATORY. I picked up the ridiculous 200USD, since I rather die before letting them keeping 1 more cent from me, and thought this was the final chapter of this bad Ethiopian movie IT WASN’T, THINGS WERE ONLY GONNA GET WORSE. I get on the plane the NEXT day at 11:30 pm Sunday (after spending one WHOLE day in Addis) battling with Ethiopian Airlines, get on the plane, get seated on my seat...and GUESS WHAT?? ANOTHER woman with a baby and I had he SAME seats assigned...and a VERY RUDE Ethiopian Airlines agent demanded I moved, since the woman had also this seat..I HAD PREVIOUSLY CONFIRMED BY PHONE AND IN PERSON WITH ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES previous to boarding to MAKE SURE they didn’t make another mistake. I demanded be moved ONLY to another HALL SEAT, and he and the stewardesses kept pushing me to move without telling me where to go, I said no several times…..the super-rude agent comes comes telling me he has “found” a hall-seat by moving another woman to Frist Class…..turns out, no upgrade for the nice lady, I had 2 seat in the MIDDLE ... he left, no explanation, stewardesses didn’t know a/thing or gave answers, rude treatment again. I tried to get explanations from the crew members, which throughout the whole experience only shown incompetence and rudeness, obviously couldn’t get any explanation or (at the very least) apologies Agents of all sorts behaved so rudely, they all gave me different information, and evidently all wrong information, I was not the only one in this situation, there were more people with me on this “journey”, so is not an isolated episode of this TERRIBLE airline WORST COSTUMER EXPERIENCE EVER.

Also, the food on board was bad and it was very cramped. The seat next to me was double-booked. However, the other aspects were fine and I got a pass to their lounge and also an aisle seat that I wanted on a very full flight. I see that the airline is flying to many other destinations outside Africa, so this is already one of the major carriers in Africa and will likely become larger.

Dec,2018.0,generally positive experience,Madrid,Cape Town,"Madrid to Cape Town via Addis Ababa . Both flights were on time and cabin crew were friendly and helpful throughout. I chose Ethiopian based on routing and overall point to point travel time. I was a bit concerned, because my connecting time in Addis was just over one hour - tighter than I think I could do at any European airport. But Ethiopian managed this with flying colors! Not only that, the overall comfort level on the planes (787 and 777) was quite acceptable, better, I think, than what I would expect on an American carrier (though lower than on, say, Emirates). The aircraft inbound to Addis from Madrid wasn't as clean as it should have been (and the toilet paper ran out in one bathroom). The aircraft outbound from Addis was properly cleaned (probably they do that kind of servicing only in the home airport), though the food on that leg was substandard (worst dessert I've ever tasted, but I would consider that a small fault). I should note that the new terminal in Addis wasn't completely ready and it was literally impossible to get information on my connecting flight's departure gate from the monitors. In the end, I trusted my Madrid-printed boarding pass, which did the trick. Verdict: not top of the heap, but my first experience on Ethiopian was a generally positive experience. In fact, I've booked another trip from Europe to South Africa with them for later in the year.",3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,AirlineQuality

But a lovely lady went above and beyond to check is in with another seat next to us to allow for the extra room that family seating would have allowed. Wow this member of staff went above and beyond and started our journey on a good note. Our flight was long with an arduous stop in Zambia, Addis, then Dublin, but the staff were warm, friendly and went the extra mile. They were lovely and made the incredibly long flight manageable.

After about 40 mins we were given one boarding pass, to Addis and told the remaining one,we will get in Addis, big mistake. In Addis at the ticketing area we were told to proceed to the gate and wait. All this time what we didnt know was that the flight was horribly overbooked. Come boarding time, the rest of us were cleared to board, the one person was told to wait. I let the rest board and stayed behind. What I witnessed was just bad, the airline staff carefully selected their own nationals who were also waiting and allowed them to board. When I enquired, I was told the reason we were waiting was because our Visa was being confirmed in Dubai. I was so disappointed because I knew it was a lie and I told them to stop playing dirty games. Long story short, we had to leave one person behind, they were at the airport the whole day and boarded the night flight to Dubai.

Dec,2018.0,Don't get your hopes up too high,Singapore,Addis Ababa International Economy,If you are expecting standard service on long haul flights then you need to keep very low expectations when flying with this airline. Its not that their service is purposefully sub par but just that this is a young airline and they have expanded too fast and are still learning the nuances of the service industry. Some of the major sore thumbs were during take off the level of cross checking was quite low. There were items left strewn about in the passageway and some passengers had their seats reclined. The seat space isn't that great and on long hauls it does matter quite a bit. The entertainment was decent enough. Food was served at regular intervals and was of passable quality. There are no hard drinks on the menu. Only beer and wine. The check in counter is quite strict about what you can take up as carry on without reason. So be prepared to check in stuff at the last minute. Oh and all flights in and out of their hub at Addis gets sprayed with passengers on board. The smell goes away fairly soon but you may not want to keep unsealed food items anywhere and carry a handkerchief with you. In short this airline has a long way and if given a choice I would probably go for a more seasoned airline,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Dec,2018.0,Worst flight experience ever,Beirut,Cape Town Central International Economy,"Where shall I start; Ok, so there were 2 flights from Beirut separated by a 50 minutes interval.. The first one (our flight) at 2:00 a.m. & the second at 2:50 a.m.. & because this airlines DONOT care about their customers they combined the 2 flights in one, departing at 2:50 a.m. Which made no time for us for layover at Ethiopia Airport (which was 50 minutes).. In Beirut they contacted the airlines and they promised they will be waiting us.. But this was not the case.. We arrived at the same time the flight to cape town departed.. The problem didn't end here.. We went to contact them, so they can arrange another flight for us to cape town on the same day (it was 31 December, & our plan was to spend the new year in cape town).. But all they did was saying sorry there are no flights today to cape town.. & you can be there by tomorrow.. (So we missed the new year eve).. Then we were obliged to wait for the next trip to Johannesburg.. We were like better something than nothing.. So we planned to spend the new year in Johannesburg.. & they promised us again that our bags will be in Johannesburg.. & when we arrived there the bags didn't arrive.. & then again we have to go to the customers service & ask for the bags.. (So we spend the new year in the airport).. Then on 1 January at 5:00 a.m. We took the plane to cape town, & again on arrival we could not find the bags.. Then again customer service, & asking for the bags.. So our loss was too huge: 1. Missing new year in Cape Town 2. Missing the chance to have a new year in Johannesburg 3. 1 night stay at a Hotel in Johannesburg 4. Clothes & other essentials & if you think we are the only people to have this issue, then you are wrong.. As we were contacting the customer service at least 5-8 people were there also at each airport with the same issues (either lost bags, or delayed flights, or or or) & I realized that they are used to that, & it is a daily issue with this airlines.. It was my first time with this airlines & definitely the last time.. & I do not & will not recommend this flight to anyone.. This airlines should stop operating..

I know they are turning into one of the strongest airlines on the continent but I didn't see why. The food was not appealing (possibly horrible) and after taking two 6 hour + flights, my kids had emptied the snack bag. The Addis airport was one of the worst I have been to in Africa (comparing it to 14). You must bring cash if you want to eat. The debit machines were all down in the 3 or 4 small restaurants and the ""bank"" sign was for a money exchange, not a bank machine. The smell of the bathrooms and ""smoking room"" was overpowering and we basically escaped to our gate, which was part of their new upgrades and quite nice. I did not find the flight attendants friendly at all. The most positive thing I can say is that seats and entertainment were good and we all slept almost all of the 9 hour flight, thanks to the plane having so many open seats. I have to mention that I was very impressed with the way the staff handled our connecting flight. We were delayed 2 hours leaving Bangkok and were transiting to Accra. The crew met us at our gate and walked us straight to the plane. I appreciated that tremendously so well done for the rescue. I would not make Ethiopian Airlines my flight of choice to get me from Asia to Africa again. During the month of December I fear don't have much of a choice.",3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

We arrived at the CT airport on the way to DUB to be handed boarding passes for a connecting flight that departed 25 hours after the ones on our tickets. The lady at the desk tried to convince me that they were the same flight (despite having different flight numbers) she offered me a hotel voucher for our stay in ADD. No thank you very much. Fortunately they were able to get us on to a Turkish Airlines flight that departed 3 hours later. Our return flight from DUB to ADD changed flight number and departed 2 hours earlier than the one we had booked and stopped in Madrid (again, Ethiopian Airlines didn’t inform us of the change). This added 3 hours onto out return flight and made for a short (1 hour) layover in ADD. The airport in ADD was horrendous. We didn’t have to check in as we were in transit but it was hot, crowded, terrible signage, no lounges, restaurants or decent bathrooms in site and the public internet was a joke. The one hour layover turned into a 2 hour layover as the flight from ADD to CPT was delayed (which sounds pretty common) but we’re just glad to be back with all of our luggage.

The airport, however, is another matter. Firstly let me make it clear that we have never checked in here, and this review is based purely on our experiences as a transit passenger. The first thing you notice when walking into the terminal building is the amount of reclining seats... practically every bit of available space on every wall you will find one. If however, the time you are going to be spending there between flights is 7.00 am to 11.00 am it's a challenge to find one available. Most of the staff seem to be on some kind of power trip as well, for example, I was physically blocked from leaving a duty free shop the way I entered, instead being forced to follow the arrows marked on the floor right around the shop to the exit. Then came check in security. The cigarette lighter that had been in my pocked for the whole of the 7 hour flight from London was confiscated for the short hop to Nairobi. WiFi is non-existent here and using either Kenyan or UK mobile data is an expensive option. My advice... take something to read for the duration of your stay",3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

I had heard that Ethiopian Airlines was very good - the best in Africa. They're better than some, not as good as others. The check-ins were efficient, the stewardesses were proficient and friendly and helpful. Cabin cleaning between flights leaves a lot to be desired (training?, supervision?). Landings were smooth. My flights arrived on time. They didn't lose any luggage. Here's the best - if you travel to Ethiopia aboard Ethiopian Airlines retain your boarding pass because any domestic flight you subsequently book qualifies for a substantial discount.

Dec,2018.0,Aircraft in need of interior update/upgrade,Addis Ababa,Frankfurt International Business Class,"Ethiopian Airlines brands itself as “The New Spirit of Africa”. Well, judging by Addis Ababa’s dingy, inefficient airport, Ethiopian’s overcrowded business lounge, and the worn-out appearance of our Boeing 777-200 (ET-ANP), that spirit is lacking. While I credit the cabin crew for their pleasant demeanor, the airline has to seriously upgrade its act at the airport and promptly retrofit its 777-200 fleet. Our aircraft was only 8 years old, but it looked a lot more tired and worn-out in the business class compartment. My seat, though it reclined to fully-flat, made really strange noises and the divider between the seats kept popping up. Safety-wise, many of the lights that indicated that the seats were in the full upright position for landing were not working. With such superficial issues, one begins to feel concern for the things that one cannot see... And to think that they use this aircraft for flights across the South Atlantic to Brazil! ET is trying and it is expanding. It will need to insure that as it tries and expands it offers a consistently good and reasonable appearing products.

The overall passenger experience is not bad considering what you're paying, but the logistical aspects of the journey can be a nightmare to deal with. Flight schedules can change several times before the flight. For us it was just flight numbers and departure times, 10 minutes earlier for one flight, an hour earlier for another. The call centre is their strong point, call them to ask about your flights often. Don't rely on the website, when it does work the info is usually outdated. When we arrived to check in for our return flight, the second leg of our journey was listed as a ""restricted leg"". This meant we could only check in for half of our flight, and neither the lady at the check-in counter or the person in the call centre could tell me why. This was complicated by our 1h45m layover suddenly becoming a 55 minute layover.

The leg room on the business class seats on the flight from Lagos and Addis Ababa were good and whilst the flight from Addis offered a slightly smaller plane (A350) compared to that from Lagos (777-300), the A350 is a fairly new plane and is quite comfortable. Two issues which I was not particularly happy with were the incoming meals to Addis. Was in my view not very tasty and somewhat poor quality but outgoing from Addis, it was much better even though I have had better. Then the way the drinks are served is a bit of a challenge to ask for more. Spirits are poured out from larger bottles and asking for a refill can be a bit of a burden.

The transportation to the hotel was horrible, no one available to explain anything to us. The next morning we were driven back to the airport.

Dec,2018.0,A Family holiday ruined,Seoul,Cape Town Central International Economy,"I'm writing this as an experienced travel agent and a brother who booked my sister's flight as a surprise visit for our family over the festive season. Let's start with the facts. According to my sister and all my clients who also travelled with Ethiopian Airlines, the food, service and on board entertainment is 3* and it marches the price you pay for your flight. The airport in Addis Ababa and their ground staff is pathetic to say the least. Even though they try to accommodate you with alternative options, hotel accommodation and vouchers, it just doesn't make up for valuable time on a pre planned holiday or valuable time spent with family. As a travel agent I will not recommend or sell this airline again. Their connecting times are horrendous. My sister will have a 15 minute layover on her return flight. How can that possibly be manageable?! I'm sorry to say it but I would gladly spend more money for a safer option as 46kg luggage is not worth this mess. My sister will now be waiting 24 hours for her luggage after it was delayed which is also pathetic as she had to overnight in Addis Ababa. My experience as a travel consultant with Ethiopian Airlines is just as dismal. They never pick up their phones, take forever to answer emails and no representative has visited our store in more than 3 years. If you have a very limited buget and don't mind missing your flight or have your luggage delayed this might work for you. Don't expect a first world airport, in fact it's the opposite of that.

At check-in they did not print the boarding pay for second half of my journey but they printed it for my son. I noticed this at the gate and was told that I can get the boarding pass at Adis Ababa. ADD airport was a mess. Only 2 attendants were printing the passes and were very slow. I met a person whose flight was leaving in 30 mins and she was standing in line to get a boarding pass. Security was a mess, chaotic and long lines. Good part was that they were calling for people on certain flights that were leaving in 30 mins and we were rushed through security. I was happy until this point and the flight was ok. Flight attendants did not pay much attention outside of food service time. I had my jewelry in carry on bag with me and still somehow my gold jewelry was stolen. Unfortunately I realized this only when I reached my destination and started to unpack later that night. I will say Take Care of your valuables and keep them in sight all the time on this airline. I have travelled on various other airlines with jewelry and never had this issue. This is the first time with Ethiopian and this experience did not impress me at all. 😔",3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

The entire experience with Ethiopian Airlines has been downright awful. Firstly 5 hr delay in departing Chicago (connection point stateside), which meant that we missed our connection in Addis for Kilimanjaro. We were told that we would be rebooked on a PM flight on Kenya Airlines from Addis to JRO but when we arrived to Addis, were told that the Kenya Airlines flight was full. In Chicago, we asked to be rebooked to another route but were told that that is not possible until flight is canceled and this flight is not canceled but delayed. We were forced to spend the night in Addis and wait for the same flight the next day. The next day the flight was delayed by 5 hrs, and then again by 1 hr. We are 2 days now delayed starting our Kili trek.

The next flight was 7hours later and we were neither provided temporary lodging nor transportation back to the city. We returned to the airport 5hours later only to find we had not been issued new tickets yet. It was mayhem, and even though we finally got on the flight, we missed our connection in Addis and ended up having to spend the night there. Which meant another nightmare of getting through lines at immigration and at the hotel assignment desk. I won't even comment on the hotel itself nor on the food provided - yes they were both that bad! But suffice it to say, tje final slap in the face was finally getting to our destination a day late WITHOUT our luggage which meant extra time spent at the airport trying to sort that out.

Dec,2018.0,Probably the worst airline in the world,Brussels,Addis Ababa International Economy,"I only flew 2 times with Etiopian Airlines, but 2 times I had major problems. The first time our flight from Brussels via Paris to Addis Ababa was cancelled. Ethiopian Airlines decided to skip Brussels and left all the passengers to fend for themselves, without prior notice, without explanation and without any help. We were stranded with some 200 passengers and had to look for another flight ourselves. Eventually we arrived more than 25 hours later at our destination. Of course we sued them and got our money back, but it is no fun nevertheless… The second time we took a national flight from Makala in Ethiopia to Addis Ababa. While all our tickets were booked, payed, confirmed and even reconfirmed, Ethiopian Airlines did not want to check us in, claiming that we had not paid for our ticket. We showed proof of payment and all other documents, but to no avail. We were forced to buy new tickets to the capital (another 340EUR) so we could board the plane. Unfortunately when we wanted to check in for our connecting flight, Ethiopian Airlines refused again to check us in, this time claiming that we did not take our first national flight, and thus they cancelled all connecting flights. We explained what happened in Makala and showed our newly paid boarding cards as proof that we did take the flight, but again to no avail… So, while Ethiopian is supposedly the best airline in Africa (imagine the other African airlines…), it is probably the worst airline in the world. They have a very messy administration, their booking system is more like Swiss cheese, their payment system sucks,… Such a bad experience never again!",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,TripAdvisor

However, the screen shows 23:55 when I arrived to Addis Abba. I had about three hours, so I decided to go somewhere else and come back by 23:10. When I came back, the bus was about to leave from the gate, so I asked the lady behind the counter ""Is this for a flight to Hong Kong (my next destination)"". She said ""No. A flight to Hong Kong is already gone"". I pointed out the screen right behind her showing ""23:55 Hong Kong/Manila"". She said ""This information is wrong. You have to go back to the customer service counter and buy another ticket"". I stood there for disbelieve. A second later, a young man from the bus came to me and said ""This bus is for a flight to Hong Kong. Harry up and get on!"". So, I got on and caught a right flight. What was she thinking?

The girl wanted us to disembark our luggage at Sao Paulo despite our through ticket to Asuncion. This would have cause us a lot of trouble with baggage allowances and convincing LATAM that we wer through passengers. Our vehement objections to this process caused her to seek experienced advice, and we got our through tickets after wasting 40 minutes, which meant that we could not browse duty-free, but had to run the length of Suvarnabhumi to catch our flight. The next part isn't the airline's fault, but it's something to consider if you are flying into Africa. Many passengers' personal hygiene isn't marvellous and we suffered 8 hours next to one such person who had already been on the plane since Hong Kong. He actually was a very nice personality, but the smell was awful and of course inescapable. In-flight service was fine, and the flight was on time. The next 12-hour leg was from Addis Ababa, and I'm sure you have heard about this airport from others. Suffice it to say that it's very, very, very basic. (No AC in African temperatures...) Passengers were not odorous, but of course any flight that totals 20 hours East to West is not a great experience. Again, good in-flight service and on time. The LATAM leg left late, flew through turbulence, but was only 1 hour 40 mins. On arrival, one of our cases (brand-new, first flight) was broken. I can't pin that on Ethiopian, but they had it for the bulk of the flight....

Dec,2018.0,Very good value for money,Cape Town Central,Vienna International Economy,"Ethiopian showed up in a comparative search as the cheapest flight from Cape Town to Vienna, and also one of the fastest - though of course, with a change of planes in Addis, not as fast an the non-stop Air Austria flight, which was considerably more expensive, It was, at any rate, quite a bit faster and also cheaper than the Emirates flight, which would have involved a huge detour. In addition, in an age when airlines are cutting corners and charging for almost every extra, Ethiopian offers a generous luggage allowance (two 23 kg bags) plus advance seat selection at no extra price. The seats are also more spacious than most, making for a a comfortable trip, even in economy. Check-in in Cape Town was, admittedly , a nightmare, largely because of the generous luggage allowance. There were whole families, each member of which had the whole luggage allowance, and not very many check-in clerks. Boarding, though, was relatively quick and efficient. On-board had some disappointments: I had booked an Asian Vegetarian meal, but this never materialised, and when I enquired, it seemed that they had no vegetarian fare on board (this was on all four legs of my trip). The stop-over in Addis was mercifully short: the airport is being refurbished, and things are rather chaotic, with no proper signposting or gate indicators: I was sent from one gate to the other three times, with no apparent information kiosk. Still, I assume this will be ironed out once the construction work is complete. All in all, the airport was crowded and disorganised, though on the return trip things were less frantic, possibly because we landed at a different time of day. Addis is, in spite of the present inconvenience, a well situated hub for flights from Africa to other continents, and the airline is in the process of building up an impressive selection of destinations. I think it will be giving the established European airlines a run for their money.",3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

I have flown business in the US on both United and Delta of which neither come close to Ethiopian. They offer menus for 3 course meals that are served in courses with white table cloths. They have 3 pages of wines to select from. Individual travel kits at each seat.

Four really lengthy queues: security to get into terminal, passport control, gate security and then, finally and most unnecessary, a huge queue to check your boarding pass and passport at the gate. This was being done (extremely slowly) by a single (sometimes two) Ethiopian Airlines employee while a selection of her colleagues just watched. Seats themselves are fine, and the inflight entertainment was decent - good screen and a reasonable selection to choose from. However, the food was atrocious, definitely the worst food i've ever had on a long-haul flight. Dinner was a ""chicken"" sandwich with a plain cous cous side dish. The ""chicken"" was some form of luncheon meat, with a pink colour and a horrible flavour. Breakfast was a bland hot dish of ""sausage"" and scrambled eggs with some foul tinned-style fruit (not fresh). The cabin crew were for the most part ok, but there was an incident with a child vomiting across the aisle from me. Despite me alerting the crew, all they did was provide the mother with napkins to clean up and made no effort to clean the vomit from the carpet and back of the seat themselves.

The Australian call centre couldn’t make the changes either. So I called the one available international call centre in Addis. 11 times. They don’t take calls from Skype or FaceTime, so it was 70 cents per minute on a landline. I was On hold for an average of 32 minutes each time. As soon as I got them to understand the changes I needed to make, I would be put on hold while they checked the system. On hold for half an hour, then the line would drop out, and I’d have to start again. Finally got a new e-ticket and thought everything was fine, until the day before the flight, when I checked online and did not see the new ticket registered.

Jan,2019.0,Medical Certificate for Travel,Dar es Salaam,Cape Town Central Africa Economy,"The worst customer service ever I had a surgery during my trip and after 3 weeks I decided to travel. I asked for a wheelchair on the day of travel in case I need it by calling the local office. The lady who picked up, Lima D'Silva, told me that I would need a medical form for this, but I told her I did not have enough time to get one. She said we cannot issue the wheelchair without it, and so I accepted that I would travel without a wheelchair. When I reached the airport to board my flight, I was refused to board because the airport staff told me that there is a comment on my ticket that I need a medical report. What I found amazing, was that from my conversation with Ms Lima, it was clear that I would not have sufficient time to arrange for a medical certificate from my doctor . I had no option but to return home with all my bags packed at 4am and decided to visit the local offices later the same day to sort the issue out. The lady, Lima, refused to accept that it was her mistake. She didn't let me finish my sentences, was rude at every step and went on to tell me that the problem is that I do not want to admit my mistake. I was asked to talk to the manager about this issue at hand, and he told me that when you asked for a wheelchair, it is a must for you to have a medical certificate. And the fact that I called meant that I definitely need it. So what I learnt from Ethiopian is that you are supposed to have this in depth knowledge on what is required, and that the people responsible for providing this information have no liability when they do not do this. I have not used a wheelchair before and I am shocked that they expected that someone would just know this! I was treated as though they have no duty on informing me, as their customer, of what is a must. Furthermore, all the staff did not have the general knowledge on English words. As if all this was not enough, upon requesting an official letter, stating that I was prevented from boarding my flight, I was outright refused, and I need it as proof for my work leave. This was a horrible experience and I am terribly disappointed in the treatment and lack of assistance I have received. I believe it should deter anyone from using this airline.

I will avoid this airline the next time I travel because I did not need to go to East Africa and it added time to my flight. Also, we landed in Dublin, Ireland and were not allowed to get off the plane or stretch as it was just a fuel stop and flight crew change. A very rude flight attendant told me I couldn’t be on my phone because we were only making a fuel stop. After flying for 8 hours, since we were on the ground I don’t see why it’s an issue to use my cell phone. I didn’t appreciate a flight attendant being in my face about this at all. When we boarded the plane the nearest bathroom was already out of service. The sign saying the bathroom was out of service was in English and many of the passengers didn’t read English. Even the flight announcements were in Amharic, make a sign your customers can read! As I sitting near the out of service bathroom multiple people asked me if the bathroom was out of order, because they couldn’t read the sign in English! The other bathroom was open but the sink was clogged up and the water was in the sink was splashing all over while I tried to use the toilet. The flight leaving Johannesburg was delayed. We arrived to the airport 3 hours early and stood in line for 2 hours, the flight left late. It was a mess like I’ve never experienced with any airline. The flight leaving Johannesburg late made us arrive late to Addis Ababa and we almost missed our connecting flight. Airport service in Addis Ababa was a continued mess. We had to go through TSA again, we were separated from our personal belongings because Ethiopian Airlines staff decided to close the line to walk through for our body scan after we had put our purses and laptops, etc on the belt. When I arrived to DC, Dulles my luggage was lost. Apparently the airline had lost it in Africa. I will be sure to avoid flying Ethiopian Airlines in the future.

Jan,2019.0,They Over Booked Addis To Frankfurt to Washington & Addis to Dublin,Nairobi,Chicago International Economy,"I took Cheapoair's offer to change my flight to a different Airline at no cost to me because in would get me to Chicago sooner and it would not be a 47 hour flight thru Dubai. I had flown via Ethiopian to Kenya with no incident. I had two separate bookings with Cheapoair thus my flights were not connected in the Airline system as connecting flights but I had alot of time. We landed in Addis at 6pm and were told the Frankfurt Flight 11:55pm was overbooked when we showed up at the counter for our boarding passes and we were put on the next day flight, 17 hours later. They were a bunch of us sent to Hotel Cyan, a common go to hotel for the Airline in Addis. It has terrible salty food,hard beds. The next flight we were put in, Addis to Dublin to Chicago 5:40pm was overbooked again! with even more passengers from different flights arriving and finding themselves in the same predicament. At this point the airline begun looking for flights on other airlines *** cheapoair advised that if I did not agree with the airline's options for me (A 3 connection flight 42 hours from the original departure time) the policy and my travel insurance stated that I could reject the ticket for a full refund processed in 30 days and book another flight separately. I did exactly that. I left several passengers at the Airport still struggling to figure out their next flight, some headed for West African nations were not given any hotel vouchers and slept at the Airport floor for 22 hours. If anything Ethiopian is an airline you must include travel insurance.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Jan,2019.0,Greed ruined our trip,Asuncion,Bangkok International Economy,"I ended my previous review of this airline by saying ""you get what you pay for"", but in our return journey we didn't even get that. We checked in on the first leg of our 37-hour trip using GOL airlines to fly to the first stop of the journey (Sao Paulo) where we were going to join an Ethiopian Airlines flight to Addis Ababa and then take another Ethiopian Airlines flight to Bangkok our destination. At checkin, we did not get boarding passes for the Ethiopian Airlines flights, but the agent apparently contacted Ethiopian and said that we would get them at Sao Paulo, writing a pass that was attached to our GOL boarding pass. Our luggage was checked through to Bangkok correctly, so we thought that collecting the boarding passes would be no problem. On arrival at Sao Paulo our names were called prior to the flight and we went to the Ethiopian agent to be told that the flight was overbooked and that our tickets would not be honoured. We protested, and were told that we had to wait to see if seats were available and that they probably would be. Despite being the first names on the list of other passengers that were also in the same situation, we saw others who arrived later receive tickets for no apparent reason; and despite continuing requests for the airline to honour its contract with us, the flight departed without us. The next flight was 24 hours later. This was a disaster for us, as my wife who is a school Principal would miss the vital first day of term, seriously affecting her job. Eight other passengers were also kicked off the flight for the same reason and we were put up at a transit hotel at Sao Paulo to wait for the next day's flight. We were told by the manager at the airport that attempts would be made to get us on another airline to ensure that we arrived on the scheduled day, but we saw no evidence that those attempts were made and I had to call other airlines from the hotel to see if there were any available flights that got us to Bangkok on the Sunday we were supposed to arrive. I was not successful, and we turned up the next day to join the Ethiopian Airlines flight out of Sao Paulo well in advance of the required time. On the previous day, we had received boarding passes all the way to Bangkok, so we assumed that at least there would be no problem with this journey. We were wrong. Our boarding passes were rejected because they had been issued on the previous day, and it looked like we were going to be delayed for another 24 hours. Fortunately, a passenger whose mother was ill turned up at the desk to hand back their tickets, and we got those and departed on the flight. No explanation was given for the second potential non-journey or why we as delayed passengers were not given priority on the flight since our seats had been selected on the computer in front of us by the agent on the previous day. We were given a voucher for $400 each as compensation for the overbooking delay and told to get it redeemed at Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Airline's hub and headquarters. We arrived at Addis Ababa and went to the office at the airport, meeting passengers from other Ethiopian flights who had had similar overbooking delays and were also trying to get their compensation. The office said that they had no money and that we would have to enter Ethiopia, go to the ticket desks at Arrivals to get paid and then go back through passport control to get our connection to Bangkok. This would have been very unwise as it is unlikely that the passport control officers would have let us through for one hour for a purpose that was neither tourism or business and we could have ended up stranded and missing our connection, so we decided to try to get our money from the Ethiopian Airlines office in Bangkok on arrival, further adding to our delays. We had to get our taxi to take us in the opposite direction from our previously-arranged trip to our home in Thailand, costing us 1000 Baht extra to go to the office where we did get our compensation (only 50% of the $400 as we wanted cash, not a voucher for another Ethiopian flight). Incidentally, the flights were OK, with none of the problems we encountered on the outward journey. However, our luggage had been damaged (again) and the presents my wife had put in the cases were partially crushed, while the wrapping around one of our cases had been torn off. Ethiopian Airlines have obviously been deliberately overbooking their flights to guarantee full aircraft, regardless of passenger contracts for on-time journeys and with no concern for the distress and actual damage caused to those passengers. If we had the money for lawyers, I would be considering legal action to at least censure the airline for this disgraceful attitude, but our resources sadly do not allow us to do that however satisfying it would be. All I can do is detail our and other's experience with this airline and recommend that potential passengers consider very carefully whether they should risk their journey with them, especially if on-time arrival is important. I can only repeat my promise that I will never fly with Ethiopian Airlines again.",3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Jan,2019.0,Refusal for the damages made to my luggage,Hong Kong,Lalibela International Economy,"I flew from Hong Kong to Lalibela via Addis Ababa. On my arrival early morning that day, my luggage was not in the same flight. I was told by the airport staff that it may come on the next flight, due to ""operational convenience "". Contrary to all other airline companies that I flew with , the Ethiopian airlines did not give me any document, and just told me if the luggage did not come on that day, I could make an ""official claim"" in the office in town. They also told me that the luggage would be delivered to my hotel once arrived. I believed them and went sightseeing. I checked with my hotel in the afternoon (2 hours after the supposed arrival time of my luggage). The hotel staff told me the luggage came but as I was not there, the deliver men took it to the office in town. At that time, I had only 20 minutes before the office closed to fetch my luggage. I managed to arrive the office within 10 minutes and found that the zipper ring for holding the padlock of my bag had been cut and the bag had been searched as a pouch attached to the inside also came off, and a metal accessory of one side of the bag was torn and nearly came off, showing a hole in the side pocket of the bag. I asked the office staff to register these damages and gave me a document. But they refused,and considered the damage was minor. I told them I could claim my insurance if I have such a document from them.but the supervisor Mr Michael Fekele refused again and told me to contact their office in Addis Ababa as this incident took place in Addis. I had no other way but did what they said. The luggage service office in Addis could not help me as they said damage claim could only be made at destination. So, no one was willing to deal with my case, even though I managed to contact the manager Mr Fikre and asked for help. He accepted Feleke's ""obervation"" and ignored my evidence for the damage. I was totally disappointed with their service. They don't care about customers because they are monopoly for domestic flights. But please reconsider again if you want to take this airline for international segments, as they will not compensate any damaged luggage, and will not even admit that it happened.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Check-in in FRA was not easy, neither on line nor in Airport and I got a bad seat in the middle of a middle section 1 row away from the rear toilets – sat in 46 F. However, they granted me space of two seats as 1 passenger did not show up. Flight full and almost on time. In Addis, busgating from remote stand took >50 Minutes to disembark the aircraft as they only provided disembarking from a single door in front. Furthermore, they provided only a single bus at a time for 300+ passengers. In FRA they failed to print out my second BP, this often happens with ET and is very annoying as one has to queue up again in Addis to get the second. In ADD, I went to Cloud Nine Lounge though I am at present ineligible without elite status and on economy ticket. However, the lounge reception were kind and let me in meanwhile they upgraded from economy to business for 15,000 miles for next leg to KGL over BJM. Cloud Nine Lounge was nice, X-mas decorations and only half full. The last trip became much more pleasurable and peaceful than the first one though on a much smaller, modest, noisy aircraft.

It departed at 11:20. We had a connecting flight to catch from Addis Ababa to Johannesburg, departing at 8:20am Jan 01, 2019. Because the Washington flight departed late, it was meant to arrive at Addis Ababa at 8:15, meaning we were only going to have 5 minutes of transfer time. To our surprise and disgust, after landing at Addis Ababa we found that the Johannesburg flight had already departed, whereas we had notified the flight crew before leaving Washington that they need to inform the Johannesburg flight crew to wait as we have been delayed. In the mist of all the chaos trying to find who can reschedule our flight to Johannesburg most of the ground staff at the airport we’re clueless. We spent about 40 minutes trying to get help. Eventually, after requesting to talk to the supervisor, we were booked on a 3:15pm flight to Johannesburg.

The full flat bed that comes on the Dreamliner wasn't there and it was an almost flat bed with the leg going in to a notch - not the most comfortable but yes you can sleep. The second leg as usual started off from the special business class boarding area where they get you on a bus 15 mins before the flight, the flight however was the big disappointment when for the 5 hour flight to Windhoek I found semi reclining seats in business class instead of full flat beds. Service was excellent however. The lounge at Addis Ababa Bole intl airport can do with a makeover especially the washrooms compared to lounges from around the world. My return trip was a bit more pleasant - surprisingly at Windhoek there was no priority boarding for business class - the 5 hour flight again was on a semi reclining seat but the Ethiopian food was gorgeous of course - I had a stopover at addis that night before connecting to Mumbai - The agent at the transit counter first booked me in an economy hotel and then later asked me to change it downstairs where I got changed to ramada. The next day the flight to Mumbai was a proper full flat seat, comfortable flight, excellent spread and of course service. Over the past months I've started to like Ethiopian as my preferred airline to travel to Africa - the perks of earning miles as a star alliance member aside, and besides the hassle of taking the flight from Mumbai, its a great option, there is a long way to go but I am sure Ethiopian would get there",3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Flight was on time, and entertainment is good. Added bonus is if you are going on to book internal flights in Ethiopia as you get a hefty discount by flying the international sector with Ethiopian.

Feb,2019.0,Just came back from Ethiopia with big disappointment of this airline.,Chicago,Addis Ababa International Economy,"My husband and I went to join a group of travelers that already were in Ethiopia for 9 days. My luggage didn't show up in Addis so we filed a claim, then learned a lady in the group lost her suitcase on her way there for 9 days already. She finally had it back the afternoon we arrived. We didn't have it until three days later. No compensation but we were glad that it was only late for three days, instead of 9 days. Toilets in the airplanes are poorly maintained. On our way to Addis, one toilet on my side is completely shut down and the other one had vanity drainage problem so water was filled to the rim of the vanity. I had to go to the other side to use the toilet and it was not clean. On my return plan, the door of one toilet couldn't be locked so the light stayed green. I went to the other one, also had vanity drainage issue. It just makes me wonder the overall quality of plane maintenance of Ethiopia Airlines.",3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

He finally got another wheelchair that didn’t have any feet placements on them and pushed her so fast down the ramp that the wheelchair almost tipped over.

Feb,2019.0,Good Service on several very long haul flights,Manila,Sao Paulo International Business Class,"Our flight in business class on Ethiopian airlines took 2 hours from Manila to Hong Kong with a one hour layover staying on the plane at Hong Kong airport.

Cloud Nine or the business class lounge, was okay with the food and offerings there average. Then there was a 12 and 1/2 hour flight to Sao Paulo Brazil. Of course regardless of business class, we were wiped out from the very long haul flights. That said Ethiopian Airlines business class can't be beat for their very reasonable and low cost flights. Our Ethiopian airlines tickets were 50% less expensive that all the other airlines business class and we checked the internet very carefully for this. Their business class service was up to or better than the same standards as many of the other major airlines, but not all.

Feb,2019.0,"Business class seat, economy class service",Dubai,Chicago International Business Class,"I booked award tickets in business class for my wife and I on a return trip from Dubai. Our route was from DXB-ADD on the A350 and then on from ADD-ORD (with a stop in DUB) on the 787. The ground service in Dubai was decent but nothing exceptional. The contract business lounge was spacious and not overly crowded and had a decent food and drink selection. Upon boarding in Dubai the A350 was nice and comfortable. It had large IFE screens, however the movie selection was extremely poor and the volume was low even at its highest setting. The flight attendants were friendly, however there was no personal attention. Although the cabin was less than half full, the attendants spent very little time seeing to guests. Aside from serving the welcome drinks and meal, they attendants never came through the cabin to see if anyone needed anything. We departed late and so had to go straight to the connecting gate in ADD. The only nice thing was that Business Class Passengers had a separate bus to the terminal. ADD Airport is old and dirty. we went straight to the gate and there was mass confusion. The guy that was checking documents at the gate was having a hard time and even after scanning the boarding passes he was hand entering information and this was taking about 5 minutes per person. The seating on the 787 provided a little more room though the aircraft was older and showed the wear a bit more. The 787 had the same IFE screen and same volume problems. While the seats were comfortable on both planes, the flight from ADD-ORD is a 17 hour flight. You would hope for a decent amount of service. There were 10 people in business class including 3 employees who were repositioning. Once again there was no personal service whatsoever. Not once did a flight attendant check to see if they could offer anything. They did not walk through the cabin with water or anything. There were no in-flight snacks in the galley and at one point I went to the galley to ask for a snack and water. All the flight attendants were gathered eating the cheese, fruit, and crackers that were part of the desert tray. When I asked for a snack they brought me a bowl of crackers that were like oversized Cheerios. To top it all off, I believe I got food poisoning from the food that was served before landing. Within 2 hours of eating this food I was puking my guts out and had to cancel my connecting flight. Since we had 3 separate crews (DXB-ADD/ ADD-DUB/ DUB-ORD) It appears that this poor service is a cultural issue with Ethiopian air and not just a random poor crew. I have flown business and/or 1st class on United, American, Etihad, KLM, and Lufthansa and economy class on countless other airlines. I can say without a doubt that this was the worst business class experience I have had and I truly believe that I have had better soft product service while flying economy class on multiple airlines than I received from Ethiopian business class. Aside from the business class seat being way better than economy on a 17 hour flight Ethiopian Airlines was a real disappointment.",1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

My departure date was then changed to a red eye flight which would have made me miss the function I was flying to....and then I had to change the dates and all arrangements that I had made. Then the same happened for my return. It was not possible to pre-select a seat, check in took ages (despite being there over 3 hours before departure). Boarding a nightmare as the flight was full and everyone rushed and there were many with huge hand luggage which caused blocked aisles and delayed boarding. There were no earphones to hear the in-flight entertainment and the seats on the plane were very hard and small. On the return flight (23h00 departure) the hostesses were sleeping in the back after they had served dinner. They were friendly, the food was palatable and fortunately this flight was not as full so there was space to sleep.

Mar,2019.0,food was a pleasant surprise,Bangkok,Hong Kong,"Bangkok to Hong Kong. I was on a 787 which was a continuation of a flight from Addis Ababa. Check in was not good. I was the first in line in the Star Gold line, and there were three open desks. But none of the staff appeared to be working. The one desk which was processing customers was dealing with someone who was clearly a difficult customer, and wouldn't be finished any time soon. Since I had only carry on luggage and had checked in online, I decided to skip the counter and verify my documents at the gate. No problem there. The plane was nearly empty--maybe 40 guests on a 787. We all got rows to ourselves. We boarded on time, but left a little bit late. The seats were worn out, this must have been one of the oldest 787s in the fleet. The entertainment system was also a bit beat up, but the selection of both international and African films was surprisingly good. The food was also a pleasant surprise, delivered quickly, tasty and hot. The inflight team had a way to go to live up to international standards. They seemed to be barely able to hide their contempt for their passengers, which seemed strange. But you could see where some of that was coming from, there appeared to be a training attendant who was constantly criticizing them, her face never broke from an angry scowl. I wouldn't not fly them again. But as long as there are other choices, I'd probably look elsewhere.",3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,AirlineQuality
Mar,2019.0,a world class airline,Bangkok,Buenos Aires,"Ethiopian airlines is a world class airline, comparable to Emirates. Plus, they’re half the price of Emirates. I recently flew ultra-long haul 23 hours each way from Bangkok to Buenos Aires and returning from Newark. Both flights had two stops for crew changes. Check in at Bangkok Airport seems disorganised and the location of the check in counters which are next to El Al means you are checking in next to armed security personnel which gives an uncomfortable feeling. My hopes went up when I visited the EVA Air lounge which was very good. Boarding was extremely disorganised, they shouted out business class passengers but I was blocked by other passengers from entering the gate. We had the older business class product which is similar to Turkish Airlines A330, but compressed into a smaller cabin. You had a choice of mimosa, champagne or orange juice on boarding, and the cabin was 50-75% full on all flights. After a late night departure, only three passengers chose to have dinner, so there was no excuse for slow service. Within an hour after takeoff, I had enjoyed a very good late night meal. They plate the food on board the aircraft and place individual elements on the tray table, rather than bringing it out on a tray. After which, I slept like a baby on their comfortable seat. A comfortable quilt is provided, business class quality, but the pillow is too small. Transfer in Addis Ababa is messy, but you manage to get through somehow. The cloud nine lounge is one of the most unique I have ever experienced, and instead of doing an ear-wrenching PA a lounge attendant walks around shouting different destinations which are ready for boarding. I felt this was acceptable as they didn’t want people missing their flights. I thoroughly enjoyed a six-course meal on the flight to São Paulo, including some local dishes. One thing they do right on Ethiopian is every chicken dish I’ve had has always been moist and not dried out. Great job on that! The crew were courteous and well-trained. They were more than willing to go the extra mile. There were Enough movies to keep me entertained for all flights. The return from Newark just proved to me they are better than Emirates. The flight was delayed due to weather and late arrival, so when they announced the delay I asked if I could wait in the business class lounge. The gate agent said she would pick us up and whisk us through when the flight was ready to board. Sure enough, 30 minutes later, the gate agent comes and sees me and whisks me and other business class passengers through a very crowded boarding area. The flight was delayed three hours due to de-icing and weather, and by the time we got to Addis Ababa, we literally had five minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave. No problem, they whisked all tight connections onto a bus and drove us straight to the plane, and I was literally the last passenger to board the plane. All these little details clearly make Ethiopian Airlines a world class airline. When I re-read their website, they define their cloud nine as “a mix between first and business class.” I can very clearly see elements in the soft product which accounts for first class service. The hard product is still business class, to be fair. I would have no hesitation in flying Ethiopian again at all.",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,AirlineQuality

Mar,2019.0,Overall - Ethiopian Airlines is better than I thought,Toronto,Victoria International Business Class,"I was a bit apprehensive after I booked my flights from Toronto to Seychelles, especially after the Boeing 737 crash. Actually, my flights were much better than I expected - planes were very clean, food was good as far as airline meals are concerned and services were good. One concern that I had was with changing planes and flights in Addis Ababa. It turned out that both connections went without a hitch. I was impressed that Ethiopian Airlines is working very hard to make Addis Ababa the hub in Africa air travel, and I think they are succeeding - my experience with them were much better than in Nairobi and Johannesburg. Anyway, a few comments based on my experience: 1. flying to Seychelles from Toronto was much cheaper with ET than other airlines (such as Emirates). 2. Air planes, especially the washrooms, were kept very clean. 3. Seats seem to be slightly more spacious than other airlines. 4. In-flight meals tastes quite good, although they do run out of choices coming to us sitting at the last rows of the plane. One complaint though is the lack of smiles in the air hostesses faces - they're efficient but not super friendly. In flight entertainment was below average. On our return flight from ADD to YYZ, we bid and got business class upgrade. The service in the business was excellent. They served many meals and a chance to taste some Ethiopian cuisine and wines. The berth was super comfortable, allowing one to lay down flat with lots of space. Two complaints though: a) didn't get business class points for my Star Alliance loyalty program despite the ""upgrade""; b) there were multiple lounges in Addis Ababa. The Cloud 9 business class lounge was like a cafeteria with luke warm food and not enough sitting space for the passengers.",3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Mar,2019.0,Ethiopian Airlines - Pleasantly surprised,Johannesburg,Phuket International Economy,"After much deliberation, and reading countless reviews, I decided to book with Ethiopian Airlines. What an excellent decision. The planes were new and clean, the staff professional and friendly and the overall service great, The 3½h lay-over at Bole International Airport was a concern but it was better than many other airports I have been through. The food on all flights were more than decent. With an Airbus A350 from JHB to Bole, Boeing 787 Dreamliner to Bangkok and connecting flight by Bangkok Airways to Phuket (Airbus A320), the 16+ hours in the air plus connecting times, the 28 hours of traveling passed without any incident or complaint. At the busy Bangkok Airport, an Ethiopian Air employee awaited us when we disembarked to accompany and navigate us to the final boarding gate. He made sure we headed in the right direction, breezed us through customs, ensured that our baggage were booked through and sent us off with his (always present) lovely smile. Now THIS is customer service and added value (for free). On the return leg, everything was in place again. Because of a flight delay AT DEPARTURE IN bANGKOK, arriving at Bole, we were taken from our aircraft by bus direct to the next airplane to save time - thus skipping all the hustle and bustle of the terminal. Despite the delay at departure in Bangkok, all flights arrived on time or even early. One negative is the amount of hand luggage that passengers bring as carry-on items. I am sure that the staff tend to turn a blind eye in lieu of good customer relations, but maybe they should be more strict in this regard.

We have been living in Africa for 7 years and had travel a lot so we didn’t expect the same flying experience from othe airlines worldwide. Departure and arrival times were good, the plane was clean when we board but become dirty pretty fast, I think is mainly due to the people that travel on these flights, the service on board was really good but the food was a bit spicy for the kids. We also learned that once onboard you can not upgrade seats. We also learned that you get a hotel booking if you have a layover for 8 hours or more, you must see website. We decided to book a better hotel than the one offered but If you are offered the newly inaugurated 5 star Skylight hotel don’t hesitate to take it. Once outside the airport we didn’t feel insecure although there was a lot of people around. At the new installations of Adis Abbaba airport there is a lot of confusion, a lot of people and the Ethiopian service clerks try to do their best to help. For visas, we got a single entry visa(50 USD) instead of the multiple entry (80 USD) but somehow on our return they didn’t ask for another entry visa.

Mar,2019.0,An excellent transit and flight experience set my mood for the Seychelles!,Addis Ababa,Victoria Africa Business Class,"I am adding my transit experience to my flight review because it is a quintessential part of it. After my arrival from Entebbe in the wee hours of the morning, was the new Terminal 2 in Addis Ababa relatively empty. Some restaurants were open as I made my way to the Cloud 9 Lounge. What a change from the past I must say, both terminal and lounge. WiFi sprang into life the moment the password was entered, there was a selection of cold and hot dishes available to snack on and eggs were prepared to order. Progressively did the lounge get busy as more flights arrived and passengers checked in for their flights took advantage of the offerings. Notably was I guided by the lounge staff to Gate 22 - the listed gate of my Seychelles flight was 6, and Gate 22 proved to be a dedicated gate for premium passengers who would be transported from there directly to their aircraft. Now THAT is a great service as it spares one the often long walks if a departure gate is at the other end of the new terminal. Subsequently did business class passengers booked on the flight to the Seychelles arrive just ahead of the doors being closed, the flight leaving on time. Last on and first off the aircraft was put into effect with precision! We were warmly welcomed on board by Purserette, aka 'Team Leader' Hirity Asgeoom and an announcement by Captain Andrade rounded up the experience. Hirity's colleague Gifty did much of the serving and clearing of dishes, glasses and cups but the available Ethiopian National Dishes on the menu were ably explained by Hirity and also served by her, needless to say with a smile and always asking if she could to anything else, refill a glass or add some food. Besides two starters and a salad were FOUR main courses available as was dessert at the end of the meal, plus a cheese board from which Hirity would cut the type and amount of cheese asked for. I tried a few sips of the Ethiopian Rift Valley Syrah red wine and, like on the flight from Entebbe when I had a few sips of the Ethiopian white wine, it again had an interesting taste and adding some authenticity to the meal. I was again happy to have chosen to fly with Ethiopian to the Seychelles, breaking with my past practice of almost 25 flights to SEZ over the past 10 years via Nairobi! We arrived well ahead of ETA and the entire flight experience was producing thumbs up for Ethiopian Airlines.",3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,TripAdvisor
Mar,2019.0,My move to Ethiopian Airlines proved to be fully justified,Entebbe,Addis Ababa Africa Business Class,"Being greeted by name once I sat down in my seat 2A continued an already very positive experience at check in. Purserette Eden Ayele, at ET the title is 'Team Leader' delivered my welcome with a broad smile, at 02.30 hrs not something I have learned to take for granted. Pushback for take off was on time, though before entering the runway we had to wait for bird control to chase away a stubborn bird which just stood there, not giving way until the vehicle arrived. Arrival in Addis Ababa was still slightly ahead of time, and the flight itself smooth with hardly a turbulence felt, Captain Abubeker doing a great job of that given the lightning seen in the distance from the windows. The drink and food service was prompt, delivery again with a smile, also from cabin attendant Samrawit Fikre who served in business class alongside her 'Team Leader'. At 3 in the a.m. I did not expect to be served a full hot meal, but that what it turned out to be. A choice of two starters and three main courses - I opted for the fish - complemented by a dessert and of course Ethiopian coffee at the end of the meal. Time just flew by, pun intended, and we were already descending into Addis Ababa. With my meal I had a good sip of an Ethiopian White Whine, Rift Valley Chardonnay, which proved interesting and went along well with the fish dish. It was my first flight in a very long time with Ethiopian and I can only say that staff on the ground and in the air were at their very best, despite the wee hours of the night.

Mar,2019.0,Neglect and ignorance,Addis Ababa,Entebbe Africa Economy,"It is with the deepest regret I admit not to have posted this review immediately this Friday. My deepest condolences to all affected by the accident on ADD-NBO today. My flights on Thursday-Friday this week we're shocking and once and for all confirmed that ET ois not an airline I will fly in the future. The first flight only proved that processes are not in place, security as such was not visibly an issue. But many passengers suffered because staff did not open toilet after take off, untill I did it myself to the relief of many passengers. The second flight (ADD-EBB) was a clear demonstration of lacking training and safety procedures and something Star Alliance should consider carefully when admitting members. After 5 complaints to the staff, just before take-off, about all three passengers in front of me ignoring the Sears upright rule, I was asked to move to an empty seat ion the back row and not disturb/ get disturbed by the non-complying passengers. How does my moving increase flight safety? Should the staff not have focused on the non-complying passengers? Also, no attention was given to passengers talking on their mobile phones during actual take-off. These were just visible signs of negligence and bad training - nobody knows what would be found at a professional audit. My definite boycott of ET (and to some extent Star Alliance) is due to the incomprehensible policy of the airline not rewarding business class passengers one single mile (points) on their flights unless they are Sheba miles members - other Star-members receive nothing! Avoid Ethiopian and consider carefully whether Star is the preferred alliance - ET is not the only member allowed membership without rewarding members.

Mar,2019.0,The scariest flight I have ever been on,Singapore,Kuala Lumpur Southeast Asia Business Class,"I had a connecting flight from Changi back to Kuala Lumpur with Ethiopian Airlines and this is probably the scariest and weirdest flight that I have been on. If you have been on business class before, there is a small placeholder for bottle and drink between two seats in business class, normally things don’t slip but with Ethiopian Airlines, when we were taking off, everything fell behind. It looks like a relatively new flight but strange that it worked this way. Fine, that’s not a big deal yet. Half way through the flight (luckily it’s only a 1-hour-flight), we encountered a turbulence. This is the worst experience I have had. The flight is pretty big, seat configuration is 2-2-2 but it feels like we are going through the turbulence with tiny airplane. It was shaky, and at one point, I felt that we were dropping in tandem for about half a minute, I really thought that I would die. Such irony, my long haul flight for 12 hours with two turbulence didn’t even wake me up. Finally, we had a hard landing back in KLIA. It hurts my back and my head. Tell you what, your money is better spent elsewhere, no more Ethiopian airlines. Better with major airlines like Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa (even though I have episodes with them but compared to Ethiopian, Lufthansa is definitely better), KLM, Turkish or Thai Airways.",5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,TripAdvisor
Apr,2019.0,experience absolutely dreadful,Cairo,Addis Ababa,"On March 21st, my girlfriend and I went to buy tickets from Cairo to Addis Ababa on Ethiopian airlines website. The first time we went to buy a ticket the card was declined. We went back to try to buy the ticket again with the same card. This time it took us an hour just to fill out information as our names kept being changed, altered, distorted, and deleted. Eventually to find out, the date was changed too. When we went to pay for those tickets, the card was declined again. We went through the whole process again of names being changed and deleted and finally paid for those tickets with a different card. That transaction was declined as well. We contacted this exact email address for help that day and there was no response ever. 2 days later we received a confirmation that tickets had been bought. I had to cancel the order on the second credit card so that we would not be charged for two purchases. Why is a purchase being made from our credit cards after the website has reportedly declined our credit cards and ceased the transaction. On April 20th I look at the tickets and the tickets were issued for Jul 22nd and not April 22nd. I had spent 3 hours being sent from person to person on phone only to be charged an extra $170 to get our tickets changed to April 22nd on a flight with many open seats, as that is how much more they cost on April 20th rather than on March 21st when I initially bought the tickets, for a problem caused by the horrific user interface set up by Ethiopian airlines and their lack of customer support. This experience with Ethiopian airlines has been absolutely dreadful and by far the worst experience of them all. Ethiopian Airlines has provided terrible care for their customers and all I have been given is one email as their appears to be no person qualified to talk to and provide us the care that should be provided.

We’d been used to direct Mumbai-London flights for so many years that there couldn’t have been any reason for us to pick Ethiopian except as a last-minute reasonably-priced switch. We were surprised when it turned out to be a good experience. We flew in a new aircraft, and everything, right from the excellent safety video to the hospitality of a decent hotel with basic meals during our layover, was a treat. I’m never surprised when I get glazed looks and impersonal treatment from cabin staff – it’s not an easy job they do. So to be talked to with individual eye contact was unexpected, and a pleasant surprise indeed. It looks like Ethiopian does a good job of training. I want to especially thank Ms Rakeb W. On our flight from Mumbai, there was a mix-up with vegetarian meals and she made quite an effort to ensure that we got a really good veg meal though it was delayed. It was a pleasant surprise to see her again 18 days later on our return journey! Thank you, Rakeb. While I must say that the airline is very good, unfortunately Addis Ababa airport is disorganized and has no priority lounge. Both times we passed through it, we stood for far too long in stupidly long, slow-moving queues.

In the end I had to pay the cost of change by myself as the certificate of death did not reach me before flying. I mean the lost money is one thing, but all the energy that I had to put in getting a ticket to fly home was too much. I would like to get an explanation why I needed to write 14 e-mails, most of them were never replied to or there occured some weird understandings of my text, why nobody told me about this manager in charge, why I could not talk to him.

I was also given a temporary Visa to leave the airport, free of cost!

I opted to have breakfast in the Cloud 9 Lounge so I left the hotel early and passing security and immigration was once again done on the double. The lounge began to fill up rapidly as connecting and departing passengers enjoyed the services while waiting for their flights to be called and simply going by the numbers entering the lounge it is clear that Ethiopian Airlines premium services are in great demand!

You might be scared by chosing an African airline for Your trip, but intrestingly Ethiopian Airlines (ET) has a much younger fleet than for example Lufthansa and a much better safety rating. You either might apply to their free of charge ""Sheba-Miles""-Bonus program or collect with any other Star Alliance Airline valuable miles on ET-flights. Interestingly they are having regularly special offers exclusively for Ethiopia itself (for example Jupiter-Hotel group in Addis Ababa). Due to the recent grounding of B737-planes they have difficulties in running all flights as scheduled, but they are highly motivated to coordinate it in the best way. Unfortunately I got a change in short notice and had a much longer lay-over in Addis Ababa than expected, but got a good and international standard hotel room at ADD Airport for free and they where highly motivated to excuse and make my stay good despite - what succeeded. The food on their flights is happily different from the every-day-standard meals of (nearly) all the other airlines, which only change their Label on the metal meal boxes, as it feels. Fresh vegetables, good salad, international food and a highly recommended service is offered by the charming and attractive flight attendands. The General variety is average standard (like in other airlines too). ET has the biggest Network in Afrika, is the biggest airline of the continent, fast growing, reliable and good connected with code-sharing partner airlines. It was the worlds second Airline, flying the new Boeing Dreamliner (787). I had to call them twice and got a contact quite quick without Long waiting lines, calling directly to Addis Ababa, some of the international numbers, mentioned at their website (Austria, Germany) are not available (anymore? / at this Moment?). Due to a mistake in my booking I also had to email them and got an answer quite quick and was even able to get a non-refundable flight refunded, since they saw that I booked a parallel flight the same Moment. The baggage/luggage regulation is average standard, even the space in the planes, comparable to all the competitors. The entertainment system is also comparable and good equipped, with international languages, but I recommend to bring Your own headphone with You, the airlines issues are quite poor (for free). An on board paper entertainment and information magazine is of high quality with nice stories and good Information of different destinations. What really make my flying ET regularly is the good network in Afrika, the atmosphere in the planes, the good Service, the good individual Food stuff and the fact that ET is among the most ""on time"" airlines. And don't forget to register for the free of charge ""Sheba-Miles"" bonus program - it's really worth it and can be used even for car rentals, hotel bookings and other Star Alliance flights.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,TripAdvisor
Apr,2019.0,Dreadful,Johannesburg,Manchester International Economy,"I had flown twice before with Ethiopian Airlines, but this was definitely my last. I find it hard to believe that an international airline can be so bad!! Where to start? The staff - obviously they do not enjoy their work, they are unhelpful, and can't be bothered We stopped in Addis, and I was flying on to Manchester. My boarding pass said the boarding gate was 12, but at the terminal, it stated gate 24. So I go to gate 24, and get up with the other passengers, and we're all asking each other, is this the flight to Manchester??? Eventually we boarded the bus through gate 23. On making my booking on line, there was no mention of the flight stopping in Brussels?? (where did that come from???) We couldn't get clarity if we had to stay on the plane or disembark. Supper was served at 01.00 in the morning, and didn't get served any breakfast at all!!! My gluten free meal had a rice salad, and potatoes served with the main!!!! It really is time that airlines had a policy about carrying children on the flights!!! We had screaming kids the whole trip, and I even had 2 sitting next to me! Absolutely nothing was said to the parents of all the screaming kids by the staff. I believe it is time to have children free flights, or that it is compulsory for children to be given a tranquilliser before the flight. No wet wipes given with the meals to wipe sticky fingers On the flights, there is a gong sounding the whole time, bong, bong, which was incredibly irritating. Did none of the staff hear it? Announcements were made the whole time in 3 languages. The English announcements were read so fast, and the words mispronounced, that they were intelligible. The volume was very low also. Had to ask for earphones, but they were so uncomfortable in my ears!!!",3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,TripAdvisor

They overbooked the flight extra 10-12 passengers and forcefully denied boarding all of us by tricking to get our valid boarding cards with seat numbers. The staff is horribly rude and they treat you as slave. The Addis Ababa airport is a joke in itself with only Ethiopian Airlines flying, no security, even aviation security officers do nothing by such harassment by the airlines. Avoid at all cost, even if they want to carry you free of cost, avoid. I wish this flight goes to hell soon and is banned of operating because of such behaviour. From stepping at check-in counter to everything horrible and rude. I Also didn't believe such words of fellow trip advisor reviews and gave a try. My bad.

Apr,2019.0,If I still smile when I leave the aircraft after my flight I sure made the right choice of airline!,Addis Ababa,Cape Town Central Africa Business Class,"My flight from Addis to Cape Town, ably steered by Capt. Nashom and F/O Abnezer gave me an insight how the Ethiopian Airlines service operates in a near full cabin. Esete Tedla and Team Leader (aka Purserette) Tisgereda Taye were at their best throughout the 6 hour flight and not once lost their smiles when serving me and 24 other hungry and thirsty passengers asking for more of this and more of that ... the mettle of a cabin crew shows when they are really busy and the crew on my flight truly was up to the task. Keeping my glass of sparkling water filled up, another cup of chamomile tea - sadly no honey available explained with a thousand apologies - please explain the Ethiopian national dishes on the menu, can I have another bun please, all responded to promptly and served with a smile. The cabin of the B777-300ER I traveled in showed a classic Business Class layout in a 2x3x2 configuration, giving 28 seats in C instead of say 24 or less. This no doubt reflects the high demand for business class seats but also allows for the more attractive fares which Ethiopian charges and explains that side of their popularity in Africa and beyond. My flight must have been near full, when peeping back into Economy I did not spot a single empty seat as far as I could see and while stretching my legs saw that only three seats in Business were empty. I had in the early hours of the morning arrived from Entebbe and spent much of the transit time in the Cloud 9 Lounge before making my way to the gate which was right at the other end of the new Terminal 2. The lounge, initially almost empty, filled up fast as more connecting passengers arrived and the Ethiopian coffee station was crowded by lovers of Ethiopian coffee. This was a flight which boarded through an air bridge, so checking through Gate 22, dedicated for Premium passengers, was not an option. I was told Gate 22 was only being used for aircraft parked on apron positions to where passengers are then bussed, important to know for transiting business class travelers looking for the shortest way to their aircraft. For me it is now more and more how I get to my destination, on time with the least hassles and still having a smile on my face when I leave the aircraft and Ethiopian - this was my 6th flight with them in the recent past - ticks all the right boxes.",3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Again, despite the wee hours, was the crew at their best. Teamleader Bezawit Taye, assisted by Hachaltu and Rebecca, were courteous and prompt in serving me a full meal at this hour, and on a flight which took less than two hours. This remains an impressive feature and earns ET high marks! Arrival in Addis was slightly ahead of time and being first off the plane was I able to fast track myself into the Cloud 9 Lounge waiting for my connecting flight to CPT to be called. Will elaborate on the lounge experience within the review of the ADD CPT review. Thumbs up to Ethiopian Airlines, the flight experience affirmed my decision to switch to ET after a more recent flight, also to Cape Town, with another airline was not so impressive!",3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

The first flight was suddenly diverted to Djibouti with little explanation. Then after 3 hours in Djibouti they flew to Addis. The crew did not communicate at all during this time and no one was sure what to do. They didn't even serve extra drinks or food. But after we got to Addis things rapidly decreased. We were all headed to a help desk with only a handful of people. We stood in a que for 3-4hrs with no food again or help or support. Then we were told we can only fly two days later to Tokyo. There were other connecting flights but the airline refused to book us on them. Then the lady simply walked away halfway through helping us and I had to go beg at a different counter. This was 6am in the morning after arriving at 2am. No one cared. There was no one to help. Eventually hours later we were put up in a hotel, but didn't have our luggage. We needed to go buy clothes and toiletries and Ethiopian Airlines didn't give any support or money for that. Nor did they try and find our bags. As I write this we wait to see if we will fly tomorrow. This is by far the most terrible airline I have flown in my life. Never ever ever again. The worst is the absolute lack of caring, not even trying to be helpful. Simple shrugging their shoulders... Can't book us on an earlier flight. Can't find our luggage. Not their problem apparently.

This time coming from Cape Town we had only 10mins to connect and for the first time l was 100% sure l would get to Entebbe without my luggage . Wow wow I don't know how they made it or how they did it we all had our bags and we couldn't believe it how fast they transferred our bags to the flight to Entebbe.

Apr,2019.0,My flights to and from Seychelles totally vindicated my decision to switch to ET,Victoria,Entebbe Africa Business Class,"From a very courteous check in at Mahe to getting my bags on the carousel in Entebbe first was it a thoroughly enjoyable experience to fly with Ethiopian Airlines. Spending time before departure at the Vallee de Mai Lounge helped to get into the right mindset and once boarded, welcomed by a smiling cabin crew team at the door was it smooth cruising all the way to Addis. Capt. Henok avoided the turbulences enroute as best as he could and the cabin crew team in business class led by Tseday all played their part to make the flight pleasant, refill cups and glasses and clear plates once I had finished my food. While in Addis was the transit experience in the new Terminal 2 again so much superior to the old days and the new Cloud 9 Lounge, while quite full, afforded time to sit down with my colleagues who were off to Accra later on and have a final chat with them. Boarding through a dedicated premium passenger gate was as easy as it comes, a short walk from the lounge, accompanied by a staff member for that matter, through a fast tracked security checkpoint and then are passengers called for their respective flights, taken by elevator to the ground level and bussed to their aircraft. This is a feature not even seen in the fancied airports of South Africa, leave alone Nairobi or my own home airport of Entebbe and earns Ethiopian Airlines high marks! It is the kind of service which earns loyalty from premium passengers! My flight home was steered by Capt. Benyam Tesfaye and cabin crew team leader Haire Awell and his team served a well booked business class section with professional courtesy and smiles. As a result of my inflight experience, and a subsequent rather different one on another airline for a trip to Cape Town, I made sure I was once again booked on Ethiopian for my upcoming trip, again to Cape Town by the way, to make sure I walk on and off the plane smiling myself.

The aircraft was comfortable (Boeing 737) but felt the service a bit lacking. No drinks/beverages were served - the crew did roll out the drinks trolley but just went by without offering to anyone except couple of seats in the front. The food was served almost at the end of the flight and I would advice people to mostly avoid it as it was mostly stale. The biggest grievance about flying this airline (I flew return also) was that both times they turned off the AC as soon as they landed and that made it very stuffy and uncomfortable.

I asked them gently if I can switch seats so I can sit next to my girl friend, very rudely the cabin crew answered “NO PLEASE COME BACK TO YOUR SEAT” then looking back at her colleague and speaking their African language and laughing. It doesn’t finish here.... when dinner service started I gently asked for a soda refill, she said to wait.... so I went to the bathroom and on the way back she deliberately hit her work trolley into my right foot and simply said sorry and kept walking.... unbelievable... so no soda refill.... ridiculous staff, we will never use their service ever again....",3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,TripAdvisor

During each call no one knew that I called before, no notes, nothing. No one had any information on my reservation and the status.

The aircraft looked very poorly maintained even though they were not that old (less than 10 years old). The cabin crew were nice overall but looked junior. They did not close all the overhead lockers on both flights, prompting a few passengers to do it themselves. I found the food quite bad, a shame considering Ethiopia's culinary heritage.

May,2019.0,Best airline for African travel,London,Lilongwe International Economy,"In the course of travelling to Malawi about once a year to visit a small charity that I support, I’ve now used Ethiopian Airlines several times. The main reasons for this are that they allow a good luggage allowance - for all the clothing and other things I take out, have a good connection hub in Addis Ababa - that is constantly improving and developing, and their aircraft are modern and pleasant to travel on. On my most recent trip I noticed a great improvement at Addis Ababa with a new departure lounge for African flight connections. The lounge previously was small, crowded and chaotic. The new lounge is much better. It should also be pointed out that toilet facilities are greatly improved.

It has advertised that a ""full refund"" will be issued to customers whose intended flight fell between March and June 2020. However, this refund will be in the form of a voucher. This means that the airline has tied up my travel funds and I have no other option but to travel with them when the airports open. The airline has stated that if I want a cash refund, a $300 penalty apply. The airline has refused to issue a cash refund without penalty as it was the airline that went ahead to cancel my flight. They have refused to offset the value of the existing ticket against repatriation costs and I have been backed into a corner where I have no other option but to wait till the airports open (hopefully my visa does not expire before then) and travel with Ethiopian air.",3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,AirlineQuality
Jun,2019.0,deal with their customers better,Washington,Kilimanjaro,"Washington to Kilimanjaro via Addis Ababa. Upon arrival at the airport at 4:30 am, i was notified my connecting flight to Washington Dulles airport had been delayed 5 hours. this would make my connecting international flight to Africa impossible to make. The affiliate airline could not find an alternative on it or any other departure that would make my connection. I called Ethiopian airlines and they did not have any solution. the only resolution was to take the international flight at the same time the next date; however they indicated there were no seats available. My trip was to climb Kilimanjaro, and a 24 hour delay would not permit me to rendezvous with my group of climbers to make the trek. Since they could not offer me a solution that could possibly work, I asked for a refund of my ticket fare and the business class upgrade that i paid for extra. I was on the phone with Ethiopian and their domestic carrier United that day about 2.5 hours, after spending and hour and a half standing in front of the United agent who was not able to help me at all at the airport. I did get some sympathy from the Ethiopian agents but no resolution while on the phone, and they hung up on me twice. In a pickle, I purchased an alternative ticket leaving later that day on another airline (KLM) that would get me to my destination in time to meet my trek guides and other climbers. I notified the airline of my intention to do so, by phone, and then I had to depart to make my trip and the subsequent 28 hours of travel to Kilimanjaro airport. I noticed that I was still being notified of the flights that I was not taking by Ethiopian, but in an effort not to further ruin a lifelong ambition trip, and in consideration of the communication difficulty from my location, i determined I would fight that refund fight after returning. My assistant carried that torch for me during my trip, several times getting on the phone, holding for extreme periods, and then getting disconnected or receiving vague promises to look into it. Upon my return from Africa, we both followed up four more times, but despite getting an eventual promise to refund my tickets, nothing has yet showed up in either an email or a credit (three weeks later). I realize this is complicated by the participation of two airlines (United and Ethiopian) but I purchased my ticket through Ethiopian and United required me to go through them to resolve my dispute. So, i cannot rate Ethiopian on their actual flights, as I did not get to take one, but as for their website and customer service, the website is minimalistic and not up to current e-commerce standards, and the customer service is either over-burdened with issues, or their practice is to try to put customers on hold so long that they eventually give up on their complaint. I had heard good reports on Ethiopian from travelers flying regularly to Africa prior to this, and several of my companions were on the flight that I missed (they flew in to Washington the night before) and they had not complaints. If Ethiopian aims to be a professional world travel airline they need to be prepared to deal with their customers better.",3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

Flight from ASM to ADD was on an old B767-300 with overhead compartments not closing properly, and half the seats unfit for air travel (seats that do not recline, no belts). The fact that Ethiopian doesn’t seem to care is beyond understanding but Eritrean aviation authorities should check the aircrafts and ground them if they keep treating customers and safety like this. Transiting through Addis is a nightmare (airport stuck in time, few dining and drinking options, not enough seats within the transit area, smoking area that is disgusting, employees literaly force you to reach your gate even if your flight is in two hours and there is nothing around boarding gates).

Jun,2019.0,Flight To Nairobi,Mumbai,Nairobi International Economy,"We were on a holiday trip to Masai Mara, Kenya and travelled Ethiopian Airlines from Mumbai to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. The Checkin queue was long, however the airline staff was efficient and the process was smooth. However, being tall we had requested for the emergency exit seats and the staff at the counter had said that she has given us the Emergency exit seats but when we got to the aircraft it wasn't so. The cabin crew was nice and they did help us adjust. The seats were comfortable and the cabin was clean, the flight was punctual and the announcements were adequate. The inflight entertainment system was a bit short on content, but for a 5 hour flight it was OK. We had requested for Vegetarian food, but there seemed to be some communication gap, however the flight crew did take care of the issue. Overall the flight was comfortable and punctual.

Jun,2019.0,Good airline but be early for check-in,Addis Ababa,Singapore International Business Class,"Ethiopian is a great airline and their business class (they do not have first class) very comfortable - their seats are adjustable in so many ways, including to a flat bed, that you can really make yourself comfortable. Since I was travelling with a recently broken arm, this says something. Staff was really helpful and concerned that I would be at ease. One thing though about Bole Airport. Business class has its own gate, where travellers for a given flight go through their (third) security check and are then bussed to their plane. While this is convenient compared to the enormous crowds for economy, it seems most international flights are leaving in the evening in a very busy schedule. Thus, traffic around the shops, and in the lounges, is heavy. Careful you leave enough time to get to your flight, ie, from entering Bole to when you get on that bus!",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,TripAdvisor

Ethiopian is fast developing to one of the major, if not the major, African airlines; I was surprised to see how many international flights they offer, and these are still expanding. Their fleet is very new and Bole Airport in AA is being built to be a major international and national hub. Staff was very courteous and helpful. I also flew business class on my way back.

Jun,2019.0,Addis Ababa to Dulles,Washington DC,Addis Ababa International Economy,"This was the first time I flew Ethiopian. On the flight from Dulles, we had a middle seat between the 2 of us so it was tolerable. The seats are hard and older. A little boy across the aisle was airsick at least 9 times during the flight. At one point was sick in the aisle. When no one came to clean it up, the man sitting next to the mess put his blanket over it to keep people from unknowingly walking through it. After that, 2 attendants came with cleaner and gloves and actually raised their voices at him for trying to help the issue. They offered no assistance to the mother who had several other children with her. My daughter and I gathered up more fresh little bags to help her. The return flight was the same uncomfortable plane. The food was basically the same unappetizing thing served over and over the almost 22 hours we were on the plane. We were delayed 2 hours on the runway to fix a broken windshield wiper and then an hour or so on a stopover to Dublin to refuel. The Addis airport gate area is terrible. You can't bring water through the security to the gate and once you are in the gate there is no place to get water and no restroom facilities. In flight entertainment had some decent movies, but I gave up trying to watch them because every time you have to go through the airlines promo video and if you paused or rewound the movie, it would start all over again with the promo video.

If we had been aware of this change we most definitely would not have booked business class but rather economy as the flights were not full & we could have had a couple of seats each & lay across them. I have repeatedly emailed the airline with no response from them at all despite their claim of world class customer relations! The other issue I have is with the ""Business Class"" lounge - the bathrooms are so dirty & smelly it is ridiculous.

To begin with, they gave me no control of the seating, so related parties with different last names were not seated together. It took 50 hours of work to get them to redo the seating, and it still wasn't correct. My consolidator told me that they raised the price $80 per person, even though they had a contract, which they were forced to absorb. The group was supposed to stay at the airline's new hotel in Addis (Starlight). At the last minute they broke the group and sent them to 8 different hotels, all of which were terrible. Someone was paid off as the Starlight was expecting the group as a whole. Totally ruined the end of the tour for everyone, they lost their farewell dinner, and were subjected to filthy conditions.

Jun,2019.0,Horrifying Experience #NeverAgain,Washington DC,Abidjan International Economy,"I was supposed to fly out from Dulles airport on June 25, 2019, on a COTE D IVOIRE flight operated by Ethiopian Airlines. Upon my arrival, at the airport, I noticed there was no-one at the counter. I figured I had just arrived too early since my flight was at 9:00 PM and it was only 5:30 PM. After waiting an hour, the ticket counter still was not open so my family and I decided to call the airline's 1-800 number. They told us that someone should have been at the counter. Simultaneously, a young lady sitting across from us then interjected and informed us that her family was going through the same situation. Her father was supposed to fly out on the same flight but they told him the flight had been canceled. She said he was downstairs in the office speaking with a representative. I proceeded downstairs to try and speak with the representative and get information as to what was going on. He reiterated the same information the young lady said and said that there was nothing he could do. At first, he refused to contact anyone and had a nonchalant attitude. As the minutes passed more passengers came and he finally got in contact with a supervisor. The supervisor was also of no help and proceeded to claim that we had been sold fake tickets and that we needed to contact our booking agents. With a crowd of approximately 20 people in their office; women and children included, Ethiopian Airlines refused to even issue out meal tickets to us, though it was already almost midnight. After six hours the airline representatives finally spoke with the booking agents and it was determined that Ethiopian did not agree with the price point COTE D IVOIRE airlines set and because of this, they ended the agreement with them, a month prior to my flight although they continued to advertise it. They refused us any services for our inconvenience, issued no apologies, simply said there was nothing they could do for us. In the end, I had to cancel my trip because there was a limited time I could go before I resumed school. I will never even attempt to fly Ethiopian again. Poor customer service is an understatement for this company.",3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

The food is fairly hit or miss but there is always something on the tray that you'll enjoy. Cabin crew tend to be quite brusque in manor but I find it quite refreshing they aren't all fake smiles & politness. Their hub at Addis Ababa is vastly improved since my last visit three years ago, they even have toilet paper in the stalls now!

Jun,2019.0,A horrendous experience,Manchester,Cape Town Central International Economy,"Our experience at Manchester airport when checking in for flight ET0729 on the 18th June was horrendous. Our baggage consisted of 1 suitcase, 1 hold-all, 2 standard-size cabin bags, my computer bag and my wife's handbag. At the bag drop we checked-in the 1 suitcase and the 1 hold-all, both at 23kg. The check-in lady weighed the 2 standard-size cabin bags at 8kg each and was happy for us to proceed to the gate. When we arrived at the gate there was a man there wearing a yellow security jacket. He insisted on weighing our 2 standard-size cabin bags, my computer bag and jacket, my wife's handbag and coat, each on top of one another on the scale, and then routed us to an aisle on the left. At the same time he allowed through, without weighing any of their hand luggage, a large group of some 30-40 passengers wearing green tee-shirts representing 'St. Margarets helping Malawi'. Many of these St. Margaret's passengers had rucksacks on their backs as well as a cabin bag, which, if applying consistency, should also have been weighed. When we boarded the plane the cabin bags and rucksacks of the large group filled many of the overhead compartments to capacity. Having joined the queue on the left, the lady who worked for Ethiopian Airways advised us that we were only permitted one piece of hand luggage each to take into the cabin, ie. my computer bag and my wife's handbag, and that the 2 standard-size cabin bags had to go into the hold. We were extremely anxious about the 2 standard-size cabin bags going into the hold as like many travellers, we put our valuables in them so that we have them with us to prevent loss as sometimes a hold bag can go missing. The lady requested payment of 80 GBP for being 10kg overweight or we wouldn't be allowed to board the flight. This was an awful lot of money to us who live in an African country with a weak currency and amounted to 10.8% of the overall fare that we had paid for the flight. Furthermore we couldn't understand how this 10kg had been derived. She advised that payment could only be in cash and not having any cash on me I had to walk 200 metres back to an ATM and then 200 metres back to the gate to pay the money and obtain a receipt. We boarded the flight feeling very aggravated and weren't able to relax or sleep during the overnight flight and consequently we did not enjoy the flight. The question needed to be asked why there had been inconsistency with only certain passengers being selected for weighing, while the large group had been waved through without weighing? My wife and I have always travelled with a standard-size cabin bag each, my computer bag and her handbag and have never had a problem with any other airline. Furthermore, as the 2 standard-size cabin bags were weighed at the original bag-drop check-in and were OK for the permitted weight, there was no reason to weigh them again at the gate check-in. Finally to rub salt in our wounds, the plane stopped in Brussels to take on passengers and many of them had extremely large bags, far more weight than we were carrying, and they had been allowed to board the plane. I've attached pictures of some of these bags in the overhead compartments. I raised our grievance with the stewardess on the plane who was horrified at what we had been charged and having spoken to her supervisor she requested my contact details and kindly forwarded my complaint to Head Office. We asked that we be treated fairly like the majority of the passengers on the plane and that the airline consider making a refund of the 80 GBP. Despite further liaison with the Customer Relations Department by email and giving the airline the opportunity to put the matter right, our pride has been further dented by the airline not taking the time to consider our complaint properly and has refused our request for a refund. Regrettably it seems, preferring a lose-lose scenario for both of us.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Flying into Terminal 1 is also very poor as the building is inadequate and immigration and customs are not handled professionally.,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Once you download the app You can change seating arrangements or food preferences. We could even tender for an upgrade to business class ( which was amazing).

Jul,2019.0,High Expectations that Ended in Terrible Disappointment,Doha,Lagos International Economy,"I decided to fly Ethiopian airlines for the first time having read good things about her new fleet. The outbound journey went quite well for the most part, despite the 55 minute layover at Addis Ababa. The return leg was where it all went awry. First, the plane that was supposed to take us to Addis Ababa arrived late, and as a result, by the time we got to Addis, the connecting flight to Doha had departed. It took several minutes for us to realize this due to the chaos we met at Bole airport when we arrived.After asking around, we were told that we were going to be booked into a hotel inside Addis Ababa till 7pm the following day.We then had to queue for over an hour with others in apparently the same situation, to obtain a visa before being taken by the hotel shuttle to our hotel. We also learnt that instead of going straight to Doha, we would be going first to Kuwait before proceeding to Doha! The hotel was okay for the most part, but the bedsheets did not look that clean, the single bed was very narrow, and the mattress was just too soft.It was also quite cold and there was no heater. We were provided 4 meals, however; 2 dinners, 1 breakfast and 1 lunch.The following night we were taken back to the airport and it was after we had gone through the security checkpoint at the entrance that we were told, on asking, that we had to exit the main airport building and go somewhere to the left of it. So we did that, but on asking someone else we we were told that we were at the wrong place and to completely leave the airport grounds and then turn left after doing so. So with two hand luggagge each we started walking out of the airport grounds and turned left on to the open road with no streetlights and walked for at at least 2.5kms, before finally getting to the part of the airport where our terminal was located. I have NEVER been in an airport where one cannot go from one part of it to the other indoors or at least with an airport shuttle to take one there. Why did the hotel shuttle not drop us off there at the outset? We then went through two more security checkpoints , one on the ground floor and the other on the upper floor before finally getting to the waiting area of our boarding gate. The plane that took us to Kuwait was very clean and for me, had the most attentive and pleasant air hostesses of all legs of the journey. There was one in particular ( unfortunately I don't remember her name) that really impressed me. This plane however was the most uncomfortable by far, with the worst leg space and worse still, no individual entertainment screens for a 5 hour flight! It had only one small screen for about 3 rows of passengers with no choice of programmes; we all had to watch the movie that was put on whether we liked it or not. So were on this cramped flight, bored silly, for 5 hours. When we arrived at Kuwait, there was no one to guide us as to how or where to go about getting seats on the Qatar Airways flight that was to take us to Doha. After walking up and down the airport at Kuwait, we finally found the stall where we were given boarding passes. The flight to Doha finally left about 2-3 hours after we arrived and after we had gone through yet another security check. On getting to Doha, we discovered after waiting at least 2 hours at the carousel for them, that our check-in luggage (11 of them) had not arrived with the flight. On inquiring about their whereabouts at the airport help desk, instead of filing a formal report of the missing luggage, they couldn't even tell us where our luggagage were, nevermind when we could expect their arrival. We asked for Ethiopian airlines office at the airport in the hope of filing a report. We went there, saw no one (the doors were all locked) and learnt theat they had all left after the arrival of an Ethiopian airlines flight earlier that morning. When we got home, we started writng and making calls to every Ethiopian airlines email addresses and phone numbers respectively both locally and at their Addis Ababa head office, that we could find. However, NONE of their representatives on any media could tell us where our luggage were and when they would be delivered. Note that we had securely attached a tag containing a name,email address, and final destination, to every single one of these luggage. They all also refused to open a formal report and provide us a reference number. 10 out of the 11 luggage arrived the following day even though we were informed that all 11 had arrived. It hen became a herculean task to get anyone to respond to our enquiries about where the last bag was and when it would arrive. No could or would tell tell us despite several call, emails, WhatsApp messages to several people both locally and internationally for several days. Note that the 11th bag was excess luggage which we had paid $240 in excess baggage charges for. We were finally informed 16 days (31st Aug) after we arrived that the last bag had been located and to come and collect it, despite the fact that we had informed them beforehand that this luggage contained only perishable food. On getting there, the luggage had been put into 2 clear large plastic bags, probably to mask the odour that must have emanating from it. Of course, as was to be expected, everything had gone bad.Hence, we formally filed and submitted a compensation claim to several people including the Ethiopian airlines Customer Service supervisor for Qatar, Wolid Al Medani. The latter responded the following day (Sept 1) acknowledging the receipt of the claim and writng that he would ""check and revert"". However, almost 2 months and several reminder emails later, neither he nor no one anyone else from Ethiopian airlines has bothered to respond. I really wanted to support this African airline but after this experience, I certainly will not be taking Ethiopian airlines anywhere except maybe on a direct flight to Addis Ababa; I liked the little I saw of the place and hope to visit again, one day. I hope Ethiopian airlines will get their act together soonest. Their very short layovers for international flights seems to be where the main problem lies.",3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

I'm 5'10, when I sat, the front seat, was pushing ON my knees, and this was without a recline! It feels as if the person in from of you is almost on your lap. I tried to put the table down, and it couldn't even go all the way done, it was useless to me (and also dirty once I opened it). I had an aisle seat, which didn't help when the flight staff would pass by with the cart. Once they passed me, and it hit me, with my arms INSIDE of the seat. The food was mush trash, that looked like food they serve in prisons. Luckily I always travel with food, so I didn't starve on this flight. Again, I caught a sale (my flight was $688 roundtrip) so I knew what i signed up for. It got me there safely, that's all I really asked for.

Jul,2019.0,A decent airline for travel to Africa,Toronto,Cape Town Central International Economy,"We were a bit nervous after booking several segments of flights on Ethiopian, and then reading many negative reviews. It turns out that our concerns were not necessary. This is a very decent airline with affordable, efficient service to destinations across Africa. We flew from Toronto-Addis Ababa-Cape Town for our first leg, then Victoria Falls (via Gabarone)-Addis Ababa for our second leg, several domestic flights (Addis-Lalibela-Gonder-Addis) and then Addis Ababa to Toronto over the course of a month. The international flights were all on relatively new planes (a 777 Toronto to Addis; a 787 Addis to Cape Town; 737-800 Vic Falls to Addis) and on Bombardier Q400s domestically. Previous reviews saying that the planes were old and tired seemed untrue to me; I think the colour scheme of gold and a sort of moss green (derived from the colours of Ethiopia) makes the planes look dated when they're actually not old. The flight attendants were all very polite and especially on the leg from Addis Ababa to Cape Town when a few passengers were particularly rude/unkind to them, and they still held their composure and smiled. The planes felt safe, and the only thing that struck me as odd is that a teenager decided to take a nap in the crossover area between the aisles, causing passengers to have to step over him or wait to cross through the galley, and the FAs let him stay there until I told one of them that I didn't think it was particularly safe (at which point she agreed and asked him to return to his seat). It was somewhat difficult to hear announcements from the cockpit - they weren't loud enough - but otherwise the safety briefings (while dated - ""put away your portable computers and CD players"") were clear and concise. Leg room, for economy class, was fairly decent. The food was actually quite edible compared to most airline meals I have had - we had ordered vegetarian meals and had no problem on any of our flights receiving these. On the domestic flights, we were quite surprised to be served complimentary snacks of muffins or cheese sandwiches. You don't go hungry on Ehtiopian Airlines - I was very surprised at how frequent the meal service was. Connections were also very efficient - we were worried about a very short connection time in Addis between our flights, but we got our luggage in Cape Town, labelled with a bright ""rapid connection"" tag. The only complaints I have have little to do with the airline, and mostly to do with the airport. While they are definitely trying - and actively seeking feedback from travellers - the airport in Addis is chaotic. Arriving 3 hours before your international flight is not enough - we were fearing we would miss our flight altogether because getting to the check in counter involved a lot of negotiation through chaotic crowds. Customs and immigration, transfers and luggage claim were pretty frustrating (and we were surprised that there was no generator in the domestic terminal when a blackout occurred). Ventilation was poor and there were limited options for buying food or water - none after you passed through the final security check into the departures/gates area. But again, this has little to do with the airline itself - just something you should be aware of if your journey begins or ends from Addis Ababa (and to be honest, I have faced some similar frustrations in Paris and London, minus the blackouts). Let's face it: flying from North America to Southern Africa is a pretty brutal journey, no matter how you look at it, but we were well taken care of on Ethiopian, and have no regrets about our choice.",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

This is not the first time I've been one of these unfortunate individuals. Due to their glitchy, error prone website I've ended up visiting a number of their booking offices to purchase tickets which should have easily been purchased online. Each visit has been a seemingly endless tale of woe. Their worst office, plumbing almost spectacular lows, must be the airport office in Entebbe. Staff clatter about texting on their phones paying no heed to the waiting customers, the manager once spent 5 minutes babbling in front of us whilst only half dressed, and even when you get someone to try to purchase the ticket for you they are rude, slow, and generally incompetent. There's then the extra charges they add for booking at the office (despite it being their fault due to the relentless failure of the website), which add insult to injury. To cap it all, as you sit in wonder, marvelling at the gross incompetence, you get to enjoy the luxury of their torn, manky chairs, which we are quite sure we spotted bedbugs on. To conclude; once you have a ticket they function just fine, almost like a normal airline, but if you need anything from their ""customer service"" be prepared for a long, frustrating, waste of time.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Some of the entertainment equipment was not functioning and some of the upolstery Was frayed, but the seats were comfortable and leg room sufficient. The service was good was good, food barely palatable and had no real relationship with Ethiopian food. The layover in Bole Airport in Addis Ababa was awful. Crowded with not enough seats,is being generous. Better toilet facilities can be found in the outhouses of the back reaches of the Canadian Rockies. Food facilities overpriced, lacking the ability to take credit cards at cashier's stands, and food below par. Above all, there seemed to be a total lack of organization. The four flight to Tel Aviv was on a 737 with no entertainment, and a snack I would rather not have eaten. The flight crew was helpful, attentive, and tried their best to improve the situation.

Departure time for one domestic flight was changed twice in one day, leaving hours earlier than the ticket I had booked, but then delayed until the departure time of the flight I had originally booked. The worst thing happened as I was sitting by the gate in terminal 1 at Addis. At the boarding time printed on my boarding card they started boarding people for my flight. There was no sign or screen telling which flight it was, and I couldn’t understand the announcement on the loudspeaker since the sound was so distorted. I queued up, gave them my boarding pass and followed the others to the plane. The flight attendant inside the plane looked at my boarding card and explained I was on the wrong plane. This was a plane headed for Djibouti (instead of Gonder, my destination)! She sent me back inside to wait for my correct flight. How could they make a security error like that?

Less than a week before we were to fly back from Seychelles to US, they notified us our flight had been cancelled. This was a major inconvenience. The customer service was terrible trying to fix the problem. The only options they wanted to give us was to leave our wonderful resort in the Seychelles a day early or day late, spend a night in Addis Abbaba, or receive very, very small refund. The refund offer was not nearly acceptable to cover THEIR mistake. They cancelled the flight last minute, and were not willing to make an equivalent change. My wife spent countless hours dealing with them, and they were not helpful in the least. I feel like other airlines would have acknowledged their mistake and provided an appropriate refund or booked us on a flight home the day our original flight was scheduled with another airline.

The carpet was stained and littered with crumbs. They had to get someone to semi-vacuum the area, but it was still disgusting. The seats lied all the way down, however very uncomfortable. I had to just breathe and meditate through an 18 hour flight with them. We stopped in Dublin to refuel to make it to Washington. It was very hard for me to tolerate the filth, but what choice do you have when you’re trying to make it to the states. All I could think was I can’t wait to shower and get clean clothes on. I’m now in Washington awaiting my flight to Dallas. I can’t wait to be home. My whole thing is my husband and I paid 14,000 round trip and the plane should be clean at the very least and comfortable.

Absolutely, the airline is the safest and best managed. Cabin crews are excellent, well trained and polite. But, connecting at Addis Ababa is still onerous. If connections are short, security queues easily consume one's connection time. The new terminal seems as if it will never open. Most flights disembark on the tarmac and one can find oneself waiting for a while in the rain. I really hope that the airport management can pick up their game to match the airline. Separately, the airline sweats its assets. Planes are turned around swiftly, So cabin wear and tear is obvious.

Jul,2019.0,Stick to your schedules. Train your staff better,Blantyre,Toronto International Economy,"After 27 years I returned to African again on ET. A good airline even if they run on African schedules. But am rather sad. We are team of 5 who chose ET because of the schedule getting us to the city we wanted with only one stop. But they changed that several times including a change at 4am on the morning we flew. This made us miss our connection of now 2 enroute stops. Our bags didn’t make it although we were told they were on the next flight arriving in a few minutes. After 2 hours the plane arrived without bags so we had to leave on a dangerous, in the dark, 2 + hour drive. 2 of our team had to return on the next day (4 hours) to collect the baggage. Increased expense and a delay of 24 hours for some of the team. On the return flights with 2 stops not one, the flight schedule was again changed. That after a layover of 5 hours which became 6. We made our last connection and was not impressed as we taxied a passenger wandered down the aisle and was just watched by a flight attendant. I’m in the middle of. an exit row of a 777 but the passengers next to me are allowed to leave shoes and bags in the aisle. The crew were told several times but did nothing. Delays are acceptable and built into schedules. The changes we faced were more than that. For their own purposes ET added extra stops taking us out of our ways and extending travel times.

However we were looked after well at the airline Hotel to catch a flight after two nights. The stay was very pleasant even though the food was not up to our expectation. Only on the third day we could catch their connection to Victoria falls. The check in was very smooth and the cabin well kept.

Jul,2019.0,Don't expect too much: Quite mediocre but not awful,Nairobi,Brussels International Economy,"This is a ""get you there without too much damage"" sort of airline: Nothing really terrible but also not in the top class (e.g. 20-30 airlines) of world carriers. Three specific things: 1. Addis Ababa is not yet a suitable hub for the number of flights it apparently is a hub for. Evidently they can accommodate many more airplanes than they can people. There are shops, restaurants and bars (all of which were quite full) but minimal seating for people awaiting flights. I and many other travelers literally sat on the floor waiting to be allowed to go through security. Once through security at the gate entrance they told me: ""Not yet; Take a seat"" which I and several others near me had a good laugh at because there were no seats. 2. The food is mediocre, and slightly confused. On the first leg of the flight I ordered beef, which was meatballs with overcooked pasta. So on the second leg I ordered chicken. Which was meatballs with overcooked pasta. I can't confirm the meat type in either meal but it seemed identical. 3. I had a very hard time being given water on the flight. It took me about 30 minutes after the meal to convince someone to let me have a glass of water, and then that was it for the remainder of the 8 hour flight. I slept for and when I awoke my throat was painfully parched and I developed a significant respiratory ailment as a result. (Dry air and a plane full of people often can lead to respiratory issues, but good airlines help prevent this by making sure you have the water you need). There was also a weird thing with an obese Congolese woman with a baby who didn't want me to recline my seat--like she hadn't paid for enough space so she wanted some of mine. I felt like she had the backing of the flight staff (i.e. not just a nutty fellow passenger, but one who was being enabled by the flight staff), though eventually I just did it. Overall, it was okayish--I got there, and nothing super traumatic happened. If you get a good price on the ticket its probably worth it, but don't expect too much.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Jul,2019.0,Not Their Usual Standard of Service,Lusaka,Toronto International Economy,"I'm usually pleased with this airline, but this time, it was certainly sub-standard. the flight was Lusaka to Addis Ababa and then a change of planes from Addis Ababa to Toronto.The food was horrendous. I had a pasta that was so overcooked that I literally picked up the entire blob at one time with my fork,,,and it had no sauce! Most of the portions were very small, and during one meal, it appeared that someone forgot to finish putting food in the container before they sealed it. My husband had twice the amount I had, and even his wasn't much. For the long flights, we ate mostly rolls and butter. On both flights, my entertainment screen had issues. I asked for earbuds and was told they didn't have them; so how are customers supposed to enjoy the entertainment on a 13 hour flight??? One flight had many children, mostly elementary school age, and they were all over the plane, except no in their seats. With so much turbulence, it would have been prudent for the flight attendants to be strictly enforcing the seat belt rule. Shortly before landing, during the descent, a father got up with 2 children and was in the restroom a long time, and then a woman also went. I couldn't believe we were so close to landing and this was not being stopped. Upon landing, a women got up and opened the overhead bin and got out all her belongings while the plane was driving to the gate. This spurred an onslaught of others who did the same. It appeared that half of our cabin was up and moving before an attendant told everyone to take their seat! I never saw anything like this, and I travel internationally quite a bit. The only plus was that the economy cabin seats are wider with more leg room than most others. I also could not get seat assignments in advance, although I booked months before, and I've been home 5 days, and I still don't have my missing luggage.",1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

I eyed the very nice business class seating, and one day would love to upgrade but that day has not yet arrived. The in flight service was fine. Not especially fantastic or great, but fine. Some of the attendants seemed to be quite relieved to be rid of us after the second leg, though this is not a concern for me. Decent food, though the granola bars were not super great, fine not stellar. Fantastic in flight entertainment system. My biggest concern may not have to do with Ethiopian airlines at all, but the hollow “star alliance” garbage. Once in Toronto, our Air Canada connection experience could not have been less helpful or more confusing. I am an experienced traveller, and I have not seen such poor service. Of course, we missed our connecting flight, told to go three different places and then dinged with extra fees. Everyone we encountered at each stage was unhelpful and seemed to be doing the very very basics of getting the customer out of their hair.

That was an accommodation included in our Business Class travel. Sadly our luggage was not stored properly and apparently left outside overnight in a torrential downpour as it is the rainy season here. We discovered that upon unpacking our clothes at the hotel to discover all our clothes were SOAKED. And the hotel had no guest laundry. So we had to send out our clothes to be dry cleaned. When our luggage arrived at CPT one piece was missing. Sadly it was my wife’s which included all of her shoes along with my shoes and all her cosmetics. We submitted a claim and were assured the bag would be on the next flight to arrive and be delivered to our hotel the next day July 4. I called the morning of July 4 and was told that the bag would be delivered to the hotel. Sadly it was not. Now it’s July 5 and my wife is fit to be tied. I’m not happy about the inconvenience and expense we’ve incurred. The hotel clerk was not encouraging as she said “...this happens all the time...” This was a trip of a lifetime. This was my retirement trip that I looked forward to for years. And to have this miserable experience foisted upon us is very regrettable.

Aug,2019.0,"TERRIBLE, CHOOSE ANOTHER AIRLINE FOR YOUR OWN SANITY",Johannesburg,Tel Aviv International Economy,"I'd used Ethiopian before domestically, and liked them a lot. I chose them for a recent celebratory trip to Israel with my elderly mother. What a disaster. Two days before departing from Johannesburg, I was informed that the flight would now depart 6 hours later. I specifically chose them because of the short layovers and convenient departure times, because of my elderly mother. After connecting, we would now arrive in Tel Aviv at 4 am instead of 8 pm the night before. I'd pre-paid a shuttle in Tel Aviv too, which at that point could still be informed of late arrival, because they had the flight number. What they didn't do, was rebook our connecting flight! When I checked in on-line the connecting flight simply wasn't there! I called the call centre again and the agent, Pawlos, had the cheek to say he'll rebook me, but that's my free change gone! After they changed the flights! That was only the start of our misery though. After sitting out the connecting time (which was now much longer than when I originally booked) in transit in Addis, they bumped us off the flight at the boarding gate during the boarding procedure! Just the two of us, my 75-year old mother and me, after midnight! They had overbooked our seats! I pointed out to haughty Megnot, the 'supervisor' that I could see there were two other seats available on that flight still and we should get them, but she said they were for crew! Why not bump the crew and serve your passengers, who had perfectly valid boarding passes and were now already seriously delayed? The very same thing had happened with the flight before ours, which departed from the same gate for Washington. There was a massive commotion as one family of 7 (there were many more passengers who had been bumped off that flight, but the 7 drew a lot of attention) was also bumped. It turned into a terrible commotion with them eventually bursting through the doors to the skybridge, which had already been closed for boarding, screaming and swearing, then some running back while others ran back onto the plane again, and so on. At no point did the ground staff even call security or the police. This carried for a good half hour, and was quite concerning to witness. Little did we know the same fate awaited us... We were then shooed all the way back to the transit area, with no offer of a golf cart or anything for my mom who was struggling to walk all that distance, to a dingy office where there seemed to be much activity but very little progress. We were told by that same snooty Megnot that we would be rebooked on the 2pm flight the next day, but ultimately we were only on the 16h35 flight, which on the day was also delayed until after 19h00!! In the meantime we had missed our shuttle, our first night in Tel Aviv, a very expensive destination, and had suffered terrible disinterest from any staff member. Not one word of apology or help or compassion whatsoever. Yes, they put us up in their hotel for the early morning, but how does that compensate for an experience like this? There are no lounges at the airport one can access unless you have some frequent flier status with Star Alliance, even if you're willing to pay, or are a member of Dragon Pass etc. and an organic juice costs you an eye-watering USD 7 a glass outside!!!! I asked for assistance in Addis to get a letter to confirm the delay for insurance purposes, and was told to contact the office in JHB because that's where the journey started. Like a fool I fell for that, and of course there was no sign of Yohannes yohannesy@ethiopianairlines.com at the JHB office, and a woman gave me his address promising he'd help me when I sent an e-mail. Needless to say, 4 emails and almost a month later, no reply or assistance of any kind. Their conduct and lack of assistance to remedy a situation they caused is disgusting, and I will never, ever fly Ethiopian again, that's for sure. I'm sure when things go well with your trip with them, you will love them, but when it goes wrong, it goes very wrong. Avoid them in case that's your bad luck too.",2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Aug,2019.0,Worst airline experience of my life,Chicago,Zanzibar Island International Economy,"My husband and I flew Ethiopian airlines to and from Tanzania (Zanzibar and Kilimanjaro), and had one of the worst overall airline experiences I've ever had. While the on-board staff was friendly and the food actually quite tasty, everything else was a disaster. The airline is disorganized, with a convoluted boarding process and no assurance that you'll end up in the seats you selected (my husband and I were separated despite having pre-selected seats). Their website is a disaster-- it offers limitted functionality, and even that often doesn't work. The interior of the planes was ratty and many seats falling apart. The biggest problem, though, was that when we arrived in Zanzibar our luggage did not, and the process of trying to get any information from Ethiopian airlines was a nightmare-- many of the phone numbers listed on their website were incorrect or no one picked up, emails sent to the airline were returned with bounceback messages. When we finally did get someone on the phone, they wouldn't give us any real information, and kept telling us to check back the next day. In the end we were without 2 of our 3 bags for 5 days, and one bag for a full week, causing us to have to rent gear to climb mount Kilimanjaro instead of having the gear we had carefully packed. We received no compensation or accommodation from the airline for this delay in baggage delivery, and even if we had, it would have been only $75/person, which is far less than the amount we had to spend to remedy the situation. I will never use this airline again and I think it should be kicked out of the star alliance.",2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

The plane is small, Bombardier turboprop, capable of taking off from the damaged runway at the Blantyre airport. I was originally scheduled on a SAA flight that left at a reasonable hour in the afternoon, leaving me a two hour layover in JNB before our next flight. That flight was abruptly canceled, leaving me with several unpleasant options. I could fly to Lilongwe and spend the night there, then fly to JNB the next morning. I could travel by road to Lilongwe, at least four hours. Or, I could take this flight at 7:30 in the morning, leaving us with 9 hours in JNB. We chose this option. The flight was acceptable. We were told that we had to check our rollaboards as there was not enough room on board. We noted several other passengers who brought bags at least as big as ours, so if you find yourself in this situation, try to take the bag aboard. The flight was uneventful. Breakfast was provided. It was OK. When we got to JNB, we went to the international transit center and checked into our flight to Dubai and on to San Francisco. We were planning to go down to the baggage claim and pick up our bags so we could carry them with us on Business class. ""No problem,"" we were told. ""We can pick them up and check them thru to San Francisco for you."" I am sorry to say the we decided to go for this option. Of course, the bags never left JNB. For all I know, they were still in Blantyre. I won't make that mistake again.

Aug,2019.0,Broken seat & Broken luggage,Addis Ababa,New Delhi International Business Class,"Transfer at ADD : First to disembark from the aircraft and no transit security check , thus did not face any waiting time or queue. Lounge : Ethiopian Airlines Cloud 9 Lounge Not crowded / chaotic as our last time here in the AM. It was literally empty when we arrived around 19:30 , with more passengers filling it up as our departure time approached. As mentioned in my previous review , this is a below average lounge , but an oasis when compared to the rest of the airport. Keep your expectations low. Boarding : Via the dedicated gate / security channel for Cloud 9 passengers. They ferry you to the aircraft in a separate bus as well. Cabin / Layout : Here comes problem no. 1 - my BROKEN SEAT. This old 767 was one of their 'Star Alliance' livery aircrafts , and expected to be the symbol of all things good & functional. Perhaps not. While we were still taxiing , I realised that my seat did not recline even an inch. If that was not shocking enough , we saw that NONE of the crew members ( including the supervisor ) had even the most basic knowledge about the seat controls for the Business Class cabin , forget expecting them to manually rectify / recline my broken seat. Any request by the other passengers regarding basic seat controls , light On/off buttons , etc. resulted in a ""fiddling game"" , followed by a standard response - ""This does not work"" ( even if it ultimately did , thanks to the 'skills' of the passengers themselves ) LUCKILY , there were a few vacant seats on this flight in the Business Class cabin , which was surprising considering most seats in Ethiopian's Business Class cabins are filled with pilots / crew. Thus , despite having assigned my seat a month in advance , I ended up sitting away from my family , with a stranger on this red-eye to DEL. Even the essential controls like the FA call button did not work here , so has to walk down to the galley even for a glass of water. What baffles me is what would have they done had the entire cabin been FULL ??? Would I have had to travel sitting for the entire duration of the flight , despite having paid so much for a Business Class seat ??? Crew / Service : Not great individually , but managed to work well as a unit together. Meal service was quicker than all our other flights. Food & Beverage : Much better than what we got on our other flights. Arrival at DEL : Here comes problem 2 - our BROKEN SUITCASE. Surprisingly , Sao Paulo does not add separate ""Priority"" tags on the luggage , and just prints the word Priority on the usual luggage identification tag. This obviously is not noticed by the ground staff in Delhi or anywhere else in the world. Forget the bags not coming early , they were the LAST to come , after 25 mins of wait. But that wasn't enough - we noticed that one of our suitcases was severely damaged , with clear indicators of a heavy impact i.e. had been thrown / fell down. Thus , it came with a missing wheel , and an entire side completely squashed. While the ground staff agreed to get the wheel replaced , they shamefully dismissed the 'squashing' as regular 'wear & tear' , which according them I should just ""accept"" as ""normal"". This was totally uncalled for. What followed was multiple calls from our end to the airline office , just to arrange a pick-up of the suitcase for the wheel replacement. Each time we were ""interrogated"" with questions that had been answered before ( suitcase's age/cost/etc. ) .Even then , the luggage handling agency wanted me to send ""pictures"" of the damage , as they wanted to bring their tools for the replacement to be done at my residence itself. This wasn't acceptable , and after much reluctance , they agreed to carry the suitcase to their workshop. End result - a shoddy repair job , with an OLD & USED wheel as a replacement. Not even the slightest effort made to rectify the squashing. Have sent multiple emails/tweets to the airline , regarding the dismal overall experience , but to no avail. And yeah , I am a Sheba Miles SILVER member as well , still this is how they behave.",2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor
Aug,2019.0,Our luggage and we arrived safely but that's about it,Tel Aviv,Johannesburg International Economy,"On both our flights from Israel to South Africa and from South Africa to Israel, the staff was either ignorant, stupid, or chose to lie when we asked questions. As we boarded the plane, we asked various flight attendants whether the flight was full. The answers ranged from ""Oh yes, completely full"" to ""Oh no, quite empty"" to ""I don't know"". It turned out that neither the first or second answer was correct, and not knowing 20 minutes before the flight takes off is unacceptable. On the return flight, the ground staff claimed that no food or drink would be served on the flight. As I ate my dinner on the plane, and enjoyed my drink, I composed this review in my head. Totally unacceptable ignorance or lying. However, we did arrive relatively on time, as did our luggage. In the future, I will do my best to avoid flying this airline.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Negative point is that Bole international Airport at Addis Ababa is below Standard and you have to go via there ,each time you travel by ET.Drinking water,Toilets ,Resaturents (we did not see any restaurent in the departure hall) are all sub standard. Also their Transfer services from one Air line to other is horrible and Night Marish.While going to JNB we have no security check at Bole after arrival from Mumbai and we reach the departure lounge at Bole for JNB smoothly. However during return from Cape town our Flight was delayed by half an hour out of total haul time of one and half hour.After arrival at Bole we told the reception staff that we are late for Mumbai,but they forced us to go for Security ,whle they had only one counter with few security staff member, they forced everybody to open shoes,belts,Coats,Mobile,walet etc.They donot have sufficiient trays and we have to throw everything directly on the conveyer Belts.Many had scratch marks on their mobiles,specs and Checking by the Staff was farcical ie no checking at all ,because they did not have staff and realised that we had little tlme left for Departure.What we find the Security Staff are not trained properly to handle International Transit passengers.Since it was a connecting flight by ET we some how reach the Boarding gate before take off .In fact we were the last few passengers to boardin.",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Aug,2019.0,Red-eye to Addis Ababa,Sao Paulo,Addis Ababa International Business Class,"Check-in : We arrived at the airport quite early , and it was a relief to see that the counters were about to open almost 4 hours in advance. We checked-in at the dedicated desk for Business Class passengers , and the process was quick. Surprisingly , they do not add separate ""Priority"" tags on the luggage , and it is printed on the usual luggage identification tag. This is futile , as baggage handling staff around the world are trained to identify separate Priority tags only. Security / Immigration : No priority lines here , but no queues anywhere as Terminal 2 isn't so crowded for International flights. Lounge : GOL Premium Lounge Ethiopian uses the old T2 at GRU , and thus assigns the GOL Lounge for use. We were too tired to walk down to the Star Alliance or AMEX Lounge in T3. The lounge was not as good as its domestic counterpart. Mediocre food & no staff present at the bar. The only saving grace were the weirdly shaped orange sofas , comfortable enough to sleep on. Boarding : Terminal 2 has the worst lighting possible , making the entire boarding drill seem dreary. Zone-wise boarding yet again , which in my opinion is terrible. Business class passengers come under Zone 2. Cabin / Layout : The old variant of a 787 Dreamliner. I personally prefer the seats in this one , as they are longer , wider & do not constrict near the footrest. Would have preferred the presence of an ottoman , like in some other airlines. The seating pattern is the usual 2-2-2. This was the first Ethiopian flight in which we saw a curtain / divider being drawn between the Business cabin & the galley. Crew / Service : A relatively new cabin crew member was responsible for our side of the cabin , and was all smiles throughout the flight. Very courteous & quick.

Aug,2019.0,Poor customer service,Los Angeles,Arusha International Business Class,"I am writing this letter to communicate my extreme displeasure with the services offered by Ethiopian Airlines, mainly the horrific customer service our family received throughout the trip. One of the main issues that our family faced was upgrading our seats. On our flight to IAD (from ADD) - despite talking to Yonah for multiple hours - half of the family was unable to upgrade due to issues with the airline computing system. Due to this inconvenience, and based Yonah's advice, we had planned to let my elderly grandparents (who have had multiple health issues in the past) take first class. During the flight, despite our explanation to the flight attendant, it was extremely difficult to give my grandparents their medicine or let the grandchildren see them. When asked, the flight attendant could give no explanation for why he wouldn't allow us to go into first class - even with the request to give medicine to the grandparents. After that, when trying to upgrade from ABB to IAD, there were multiple difficulties in processing the payments and upgrading seats. First, when we tried to make payment for the upgrades, the airline claimed that the payment had been rejected. However, when checking with the credit card company, there was no recorded attempt for any payment. Not only that, but the process to get upgraded was horrific. After various unsuccessful attempts to upgrade online, we called the call center only to find that each representative would pass us off to another department/person who would be unable to help us - this resulted in many hours spent trying to upgrade and check-in while the representatives were underqualified and unable to assist us. In the end, we were told that the first-class flight was completely full - however, on the plane, there were 5 seats open that could have otherwise been filled. While on the flights, despite booking a month in advance, there was only one food option for the asian-vegetarian menu. This caused the family to eat the same food 5 times on one flight leg - to the point that many members of the family were feeling sick. Overall, the quality of airline and customer service was beyond negligible. The level of underqualified personnel is deplorable and frustrating - such that we do not plan on taking the airline again.",3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Lounge : Ethiopian Airlines Cloud 9 Lounge Horrible is the word. JAMPACKED. Hardly any seats left when we arrived. Rude agents at the desk just make things worse. The F&B options are avoidable. Washrooms are cramped up. The Wifi works & is the only saving grace. Boarding for flights is announced by the staff. Boarding : Via the dedicated security gate for Cloud 9 passengers.

Service : Not over-friendly or over-courteous. In short , they did their job well , and as expected. Meal services till GRU were painfully slow though. Food & Beverage : Much better than expected , but service was painfully slow. There were 2 meals till GRU - Lunch & Hot meal , & another hot meal from GRU to EZE. Do try the Ethiopian options.

Aug,2019.0,Morning flight from Delhi to ADD,New Delhi,Addis Ababa International Business Class,"Check-in : At the dedicated Business Class counter. Happy to see the presence of multiple agents who were alert , attentive & helpful. The entire process took the usual time expected for 4 passengers. Since we were eligible for STPC at ADD , our names were already on their list & we were told that we would be handed the vouchers at the boarding gate. In short , everything was streamlined. Immigration / Security : Via the dedicated queues for First/Business class passengers. The security check took a pretty long time as the crew of a certain airline was using this line rather than the one assigned for them. Lounge : Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge Much better in terms of comfort , but nothing great when it comes to F&B Boarding : An agent immediately recognized us when we approached the gate , and handed us our STPC vouchers. While there were multiple errors in them ( name , gender , etc. ) , but the agent corrected them with a pen , promising that it would not cause any problem ( and indeed there was none ). Boarding for Business class passengers was through a separate queue but a common aerobridge. Cabin / Layout : This was a 767 aircraft with seats in 2-2-2 fashion. Honestly , the seats are not as comfortable as desired for a flight of this duration. They do turn into lie-flat beds , but feel a bit inclined near the bulky headrest. Plenty of seats in a not-so-occupied cabin. As per some unwritten rule , Ethiopian crew do not draw any curtain / divider during their flights between the Business & Economy cabins. Service : They did their job fine , without being over courteous or friendly. Nothing much to write about. The meal service was painfully slow though. Arrival : Our aircraft kept waiting at an aerobridge gate for someone to operate , but had to rely on buses to transport the passengers. There was no separate bus for Business class passengers. We headed to the STPC/Transfer desk and stood in the separate queue marked for Business class passengers , which was not taken well by the Economy passengers already waiting for their turn at the one-person manned desk ( who honestly was busy chatting with passengers rather than clearing up the queue faster ). Luckily for us , we were told that our vouchers were good enough and we were handed 4 yellow ""visa free/paid for"" coupons. Immigration was quick , and we met an airline agent handling STPCs right at the gate after the baggage belts. She told us to wait for 5 minutes , after which we went to the parking where a friendly staff member of Skylight Hotel was waiting for us.",2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Aug,2019.0,Efficient service and flight but the plane was terrible,Dar es Salaam,Lilongwe Africa Economy,"This is a Malawian Airlines flight in an Ethiopian Airlines plane, sort of code share. Check in and boarding was fine, but the plane. Wow. The plane used is a Dash Q400. Don’t know how old it is, but the plane smelled really bad of body odor and bodily fluids. The seats are filthy. The overall interior filthy and you can see squashed bug carcasses stuck to the windows, walls and ceilings. I even had a cockroach run up the seat in front of me. The food served (breakfast) was totally inedible. Whose bright idea it is to serve fried egg as a meal, should be sacked. The egg was covered in some kind of white ”sauce”, the potatoes were black. The sausage was okay though as was the bread roll even though it was a little bit stale. Flight staff were friendly and did the best they could. Having flown Ethiopian internationally a few times, this is not their usual effort, even if it is being flown as a Malawian Airlines flight, it still carries all Ethiopian markings, including flight number. You really should take this plane out of service and fumigate and deep clean it. It’s that disgusting.

Therefore, I have been using their services (reluctantly) since 2016. The service is horrible from all standpoints (scheduling/timekeeping, customer service, poor web site, poor application, poor in-flight services (food and on-board personnel) , poor loyalty/miles services (in nearly 4 years I’ve not been able to use any of the Shebamiles so painfully collected!, etc.). In this many years, I have not had a single restful experience with Ethiopian Airlines. Delayed flights, poor connection times, damaged luggage, stolen items (from luggage), poor hotels provided for connecting flights and the list goes on and on, are a common occurrence. What hurts the most is the silence from all departments regarding complaints filed over these years. I have flown other airlines in this same time and I can honestly say, Ethiopian Airlines is at the bottom of the pile in every aspect. The lack of customer service and feedback pre and post flight is unforgivable. If I had another choice when flying out of this city, I’d never fly with Ethiopian Airlines again. My most recent complaint regarding damaged and delayed luggage has been left unanswered since January 2019. Perhaps they are sorting through millions and millions of complaints and will get to mine, eventually. If you have a choice, choose any other airline and save yourself the stress of dealing with this most unprofessional airline.

When I called the Airlines to check with them, they told that as per their baggage policy, I should have reported this before leaving the airport. This according to me is absolutely ridiculous.

Aug,2019.0,"Try another plane. Nice airline, horrible Addis airport.",Bangkok,Addis Ababa International Economy,"This airline is enjoying popular reviews. Perhaps first time travelers. In our recent four flight experience we found the airline safe for which we are thankful. The staff are mediocre although some are truly trying hard to please. The food is well below acceptable. For the interested we will provide info below which may help make decisions. In some parts it is not a nice read ... As alluded above we recently concluded four long flights on Ethiopian Airlines. This is a truly ""African Airlime"". One needs to have lived in Africa to fully understand the significance of that concept. Ethiopian Airlines is obviously to us trying to pitch itself against other global carriers. As one of our network said this weekend in word-of-mouth discussion ""to become Africa's hub"". But they are falling far short. Their country (Addis Ababa airport) and Chinese backers are severely letting the airline down. On the credit side, several aspects about Ethiopian are positive: Seating GOOD LEGROOM. Safety: SO FAR SO GOOD. Not a Malaysian Airlines scenario. The food was quite UN-appealing on our flights, closely resembled military style food in remote locations. Not at all worth giving any praise to. The one Ethiopian beer we had was great. Thank you. The staff were African. While this is the Airlines call as to whom they recruit - if they are pitching against the likes of the big and successful players - such as Emirates and Turkish - then they need to up their game. PUT national pride in their posckets and recruit internationally and ectically. They can't have everything ""both ways"". In terms of cleanliness - something of a horror story on the way from Bangkok to Addis: There was mainly an African clientele onboard who seemed to disembark at Addis. We watched them go to collect luggage. The behaviors onboard was not a problem except for LITTER. The passengers simply threw everything and anything into the aisles. They looked like a disaster area and we had to pick our way through detritus and litter as we went on our occasional walkabouts. "" Welcome to Africa and litter"". A complete human disgrace. On disembarking in Addis and picking our way around litter in economy class we noticed that Business Class isles were impeccable. Reason ????? We are not business consultants. However, we are reliable TripAdvisor Advisors. Our tuppence worth... Ethiopian Airlines, sort out the airport at Addis (a complete disgrace), either get you own people to stop littering - or get someone to clean up the isles during flights - and leave them reasonably hygienic such as it was in the Business Class section. We will not enclose pics. They are too upsetting and won't add value. We have made our points ... Recommendation to friends and family -- use another airline. We have instructed our agents to delete Ethiopian from our repertoire of airlines. It is not worth the one or two hundred dollars saved to put up with the horrible conditions and service (what service) at Addis airport.",3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

And it was going to be my 1005th & 1006th flights, and I have flown over 140 airlines worldwide . So I am no rookie. Was excited at first to fly the new, impressive Airbus 350-900 and then the Boeing 787-8 (with the misgivinging name of Dreamliner..). In both planes the entertainment screens did not work neither for me nor my fellow passengers. We told the crew, but no reaction or assistance. Only an overbearing shrug with the shoulders. We are taking about 15 hours in the air... The food was nothing special at all, and not much. Air Namibia does better in a two hour flight... On the flight from Addis we took off at 23.40 and it took 2 - two hours - before we got served! What was the crew up to, I wonder. Didn’t leave much time for sleeping before preparations begore touch down in Stockholm on the way to Oslo. I think it is natural to compare EA to Turkish Airlines and South African Airlines, and then they rate far behind. I won’t even bring up Quatar, Emirates and Singapore, they are in another league. And the Airport in Addis (after 4 transit visits to Oliver Tambo in Johannesburg in 3 weeks) is truly a nightmare of a noisy, overloaded anthill of an international hub. Absolutely impossible to understand a single word of the announcements! Who doesn’t anybody tell them that?? Unfortunately, others rather frequent fliers on EA I talked to confirmed my impression. Normally, I am easy to please, and don’t write critical and negative reviews, but this time I was so dissapointed... Turkish next time 😎, if I can make it fit in...",1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

In more than half of the cases your flight will be canceled due to the weather, and you will be stuck at the airport without any information of help whatsoever (no transport, no hotel). In fact, the only info you get is: come back tomorrow. And as EA does not refund if a cancelation is due to weather, you will not only lose your money but still have to arrange an expensive transport by road. Considering that more than half of the flights were canceled during the fortnight before our flights, it is a shame that they still offer these flights in the wet season.

First, I was asked to pay a high fee for a ticket I didn't mean to book. Second, they make empty promises. Basically, they tell you what you want to hear and then unfortunately don""t deal with the problem. I have had one attendant not email me after he said he would (so I couldnt contact him on the issue again) and a second who simply doesn""t respond to my inquiries if the issue is being dealt with. They say the problem is with managment, but I think they are trying to buy time to have me pay the fee in the end, to at least get some of my money back. The service is really slow and I fear if there was an even worse problem, they wouldn""t be of much help. I recommend choosing a more reliable airline, who know what customer service should look like. I have paid double the amount for a single flight now and I don""t see a chance of getting the money back!

Otherwise, meals are the same thing I've been eating on mainstream airlines for the last 23 years. Good, but nothing to write home about.

I filled my bottle with water and had enough to drink until we got on the aircraft. From these gates one is being bussed to the departing aircraft. My seat 12B proved to be wet so I was lucky to be able to shift to 12C which was not occupied.

Remember my initial flight was to leave Nairobi on Monday 18:55 and arrive in Finland on Tuesday at 10:40. With those two options, I opted to leave on Tuesday at 18:15 and arrive on Wednesday 1040 considering I had a young child. To my shock I arrived at the airport, trying to check in, they said my names are not visible. It was a stand off,, I showed them the e-mails and after 3 hours they said its the airline mistake that they had not communicated of the changes. I was in dilemma since my flight had already left. They kept me in the airport and did not even agree to cater for my transport to a hotel neither did they agree to pay for my Hotel. So the next option was to travel on Wednesday at 1700 and arrive on Thursday. That is a whole week wasted on my side and was not able to go for my Doc appointment.

Sep,2019.0,Terrible customer service - Cape Town & Addis,Cape Town Central,Rome International Economy,"I had a one-way ticket with Ethiopian to fly from Cape Town to Rome, Italy, and was traveling on my US passport. According to Schengen rules, we’re allowed 90 days in the EU with a passport of at least 6-month validity. However, ET refused to allow me to board until I purchased an exit ticket. I had planned to stay a few weeks but hadn’t yet purchased the flight to my next destination. The floor manager told me I must buy a ticket on the spot before I could board. And where is this info on their site? Nowhere. What about during booking? Nothing. I tried so many times to purchase fully refundable tickets, but the prices were astronomical - and my credit cards wouldn’t authorize as it was over my transaction limit. Because nothing worked, I missed my flight and then had to pay an additional $292 in change fees and flight differences. It was only AFTER the flight closed that someone at the counter said I could have made a temporary booking on ET’s website. Ridiculous. Furthermore, I called ET’s call center at least TEN TIMES and four of those, I kept getting cut off at 14 mins 59 seconds. In another call, I was on hold for 30 mins. They took ages to rebook me. I reckon I was on hold waiting for their self-acknowledged “slow systems” to function for about 3 hours. And each time, someone quoted me a different fare. They have zero clue what consistency means. If you like to gamble, fly with them; they’re just fine as long as nothing happens. After all these years of flying ET, I will never choose them again. I’ll take anything else — Kenyan airlines, SA airways, Emirates.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor
Sep,2019.0,Gets you from point A to B; lower your expectations for comfort,Zanzibar Island,Frankfurt International Economy,"First, I want to point out that this airline did get me from point A to point B. That was successful. However, if you have any expectations about this airline based on other airline experiences, you will be disappointed. First of all, they changed my flight from a 2-hour direct flight to a 4-hour flight with a layover. it's good that i had free time such that I could leave an hour earlier and could arrive an hour later. Oh! and I was travelling with my wife and although her flight details were updated, mine weren't -- if it wasn't for her reservation, iwouldn't have known about the change in flights.. The website and the iphone app were not helpful at all in seeing flight status, in seeing what seats were available, in seeing what gate # my flight, etc. Seats were tight, but not as tight as some airlines. On the plane, there was no control over the air conditioning -- there are no overhead vents to direct cool air on you.. Instead you sit in your seat and sweat. Sweat for hours because the A/C controls are under control by the pilots. My armrest was falling apart -- I nearly cut my arm on the jagged metal edges of the armrest. Side panels had popped out. The light switches on the armrest (overhead light, flight-attendant-request, etc.) are positioned in such a way that you constantly trigger the switches by accident.. if you put your arm on the armrest, you trigger the FA-request light..It wasn't just me being clumsy, it was the people in front of me and the people across the aisle from me, making this mistake as well. The meals were tasteless. Similar to my initial comment -- the fact that they give you food is good; you simply need to have very very low expectations about the tastiness of what is offered to you. It is a basic service that gets you from point A to point B; however, if you expect any level of comfort, confidence, or convenience, you should look for another airline. I'm not mentioning the other things that are outside of the company's control such as passengers that haven't bathed in several days, other passengers that are wearing excess cologe, other passengers that have crying newborns for the entire flight, other passengers that",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Thankfully I had enough time between my flight. Due to language barrier, the staff that attended to me didnt tell me exactly what the issue was. When I was flying out from Lagos and pressed for time, first of all their Ethiopian airline staff came in late that Saturday morning, and I had to pay extra for an Air Cote D'Voire ticket so I dont miss trip to catch my connecting flight.

There was almost no choice of music and what there was appears to have been selected by someone with zero knowledge. The headphones are NOT Noise Cancelling - unlike most other airlines, so hearing the audio over the engine noise was difficult. Another area where they need to seriously up their game. Cloud 9, the so called Business Class Lounge in Bole Airport is appalling. When we arrived, there were no seats available & all tables were taken, people were sat wherever they could – it was as far from comfortable as you can imagine.

They offered 75 dollars for the 3 instead of 75 pp, and now they offered 840 dollars in compensation based on fictitious weight of the suitcases, which together with the contents are evaluated at least six fold, disregarding the uncomfort we had, or the amount we spent to buy minimal needs on site. This is an unprofessional, unfair and improper attitude, and should be taken into account when you have an option other than Ethiopian.

We have carry on luggage but because it was a small plane and a 50 minute flight we decided to check it. Big mistake. Our luggage was not put on our plane. Not because they lost it or because we were late checking in but because they decided the plane would be overloaded. We and about 15 other passengers didn't discover this until we were in Addis Ababa and no luggage. They told us it would be on the next plane which didn't show up for 3 hours. This was our vacation and we had plans that didn't include sitting in the airport all that time. Talking to other people I found out this wasn't an isolated incident but has happened before.

Flat beds is what I'm after ,and ET sells them for a reasonable rates to Africa.Thats why I use ET a lot.However service and food leaves much to be desired. Crews are gentle and polite,but service is ridiculously slow,taking presious sleep time on late night flights or early morning flights. They don't have menues on many times,or hand you a dirty used one.I saw the girls collecting the menus after the flight for reuse. Sometimes they forget to service you at all,especially at night when they assume ( and hope) everyone is asleep.I had to call them and ask them 'where is my food'...they apologized saying they thought I was asleep.Thats what happens when the crew does not greet you or discuss dinning options with you on late flights when you board. Very impersonal service,they don't use your name,and many times forget to collect dirty dishes ,especially from desert services...it seems that after 80% of the service process their battery is dead.I had to bring it myself to the galley. Their 777-300 is awful with 2-3-2 configuration in Business,imagine being in a middle seat while paying Business fares.An outdated Business class,but I guess they will never change it,as the 777 are getting old,and new planes come into service. In the mean time passengers who paid thousands of usd must accept thus subpar Business Class.The Dreamliner are much better,but still overall service is lacking,and food quality is 2or 3 on a scale of 1-10. Their crews also do not monitor the exclusivisty of Business Class and Economy Class passengers keep coming in to use the bathrooms,creating waiting time that should have never been allowed to happen. It's very hard to be upset with the crew as they are so gentle and polite,but ET must up their game.Unfortunately it won't happen,as they were smart enough to create a monopoly in Africa,and many times only ET can take you where you need to go. But as I said,I'm after my flatbed,and the rest is an extra,an extra that ET delivers in a very poor manner.

He was unable to get to the toilet because he felt on the verge of passing out so unfortunately had to use the ‘discomfort’ bags. When a member of the cabin crew passed,we politely asked for some more and she abruptly said they’re in front of you! When we explained we’d used them,she rolled her eyes then came back and virtually threw one at my husband! Never asked after his welfare or if he needed water or anything! Whether she assumed he’d been drinking I don’t know,but that’s not the point! He hadn’t and I was distressed because I thought he was seriously ill,but they couldn’t have cared less. I suggest the airline might make better provisions to ensure better customer relations/care/service.

Nov,2019.0,inability to think critically to fix/solve problems,Kigali,Tokyo,"Kigali to Tokyo via Addis Ababa. Terrible airline. I am often forced to fly Ethiopian as I work throughout Africa and there aren't choices for carriers. If anything (anything at all) goes slightly awry relative the original plans (flight delays, bad weather, ticket date change, upgrading), they are absolutely incompetent and unable to to provide any customer service. I've been re-booked on a different flight without notice, only finding out at the airport, and told to go back home. On other occasions, I've had to change the ticket, but had tremendous issues reaching their so-called ""global call centre"", which, despite being '24 hours' often seems to have no one working. Rescheduled/delayed flights often lead to missed connections on other Ethiopian planes, but those later flight-legs are not fixed by the airline, so you're left with a lot of trouble-shooting that you must attempt to do on your own via the '24 hour' call centre. I fly frequently (2-3x per month) for work, but aim to avoid Ethiopian whenever I can, as I know that they will mess something up every third time, and at that stage, it becomes a personal nightmare to fix. Oh, and not to mention that they often lose your luggage, even on business class, and won't deliver the lost luggage to your home once found. Finally, what worries me most is the inability to think critically to fix/solve problems. People within the company don't appear to have the latitude to fix issues that arise (if things don't go exactly as per protocol, then everything breaks down and no one takes initiative). It doesn't make me feel particularly safe when an airline's team members, including senior managers, don't appear to have the latitude to problem-solve in the case of unexpected circumstances.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

After rebooking my ticket, they then issued me boarding passes for Yaounde, which was not my final destination since I am going to Cape Town, this resulted in another 40-minutes wasted! Then they realise that they did not do the layover booking for us, and they once again had to do it over again. How bad can it get for a single mom travelling with two children?

Geneva to Rome to Addis to Lilongwe at around 20 hours. Not great but the alternative routes were longer. Of course booking seat assignments with the various Alitalia co-shares and other corporate complexities was difficult and last minute ""ask at the airport"" but I am used to that now as part of business travel using the ""least expensive no frills beyond getting a pass to get on the plane"" tickets. The old days when you could have an assigned seat were golden years and are long gone. The trouble started with an odd SMS text that said that my flight from Addis to Lilongwe would be leaving 10 minutes earlier but arriving an hour or so later. Hmm--nice of them to let me know but that seems odd. Contacted my travel agent and they were unaware of what was up. Spoke with Alitalia at airport in GVA and Rome and they were unhelpful--nothing on their computer as to why the delay. Contacted Ethiopian in Addis and then I finally found out that they had added a stop in Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo! And that they do this regularly! Apparently they sell the flight without this regular stop in DRC and then add the stop after purchase to unsuspecting customers. Most people would likely avoid yet another stop in DRC. Thankfully it is not near conflict zones but still not exactly a place I wanted to touch down and spend an hour on the tarmac while they took on passengers and re-fueled the plane. Not going to go into service or the fact that one barbarian passenger decided to put his meal tray on the cabin floor near the emergency exits--it stayed there for an hour or so--thankfully others did not follow suit or the aisles would have been filled with trash. Guess that's how they roll where he comes from--trash the public space with no thought of other people. Arrived in Lilongwe crushed and late, the hotel had given away our room at 4PM and we stayed in another nearby hotel. Contacted Alitalia and Ethiopian Air and they said the fine print says they can switch out equipment and land wherever they like. Perhaps true but felt like bait and switch to offer one flight and then add a stop in a different country that advertised. Perhaps one time change could understand but my understanding is that they do this regularly to game the search engines. Shameful people but suppose anyway to make a buck. Next time I will ignore the search engine results and use another airline.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Nov,2019.0,Overall our experience was good but only because we upgraded.,London,Victoria Falls International Business Class,"Since I was unable to find any way to request or buy extra legroom (I'm 6ft 4in tall with very long legs) we decided to upgrade to business class - something we have never done before and, in view of the ridiculous cost, will probably never do again. Our outbound flight on an A350 was wonderfully comfortable and the crew were very attentive. We chose the front row, centre seats because the foot-well is larger on that row. The space advantage for my feet was fine but, when trying to sleep the flicker of light as crew moved through the galley curtain was disturbing. Food was good although not exceptional - one issue was that we didn't know which meal (of those shown in the menu booklet) was being served until the food arrived. The choice of drinks was very good. Our second leg, on a B787, Addis Ababa to Victoria Falls, was similarly comfortable. Being in daylight, I had selected a window/aisle seat pair. The seats did not recline fully flat but this was not an issue for us. Food and drinks were as described above. Our return to Heathrow via Addis Ababa began with a long leg of a circular route from Victoria Falls, via Gabarone, to Addis. This was on an old 737 and the seating was very similar to that provided in premium economy cabins today. Ethiopian Airlines we badly affected by the 737 MAX crash and subsequent grounding so the use of older aircraft has been necessary. Food and drinks were similar to those described above. Our final leg, back to Heathrow, was very similar to my description for the first flight. The lounges provided at Heathrow and Victoria Falls were very good. We did not have time to use the lounge at Addis outbound. We needed to use a lounge during our homeward journey since we had a 4 hour wait in Addis. The Cloud Nine lounge was a serious disappointment - it is huge but, when we arrived it was almost full. We eventually found two upright chairs. After some time a gentleman offered us a pair of comfortable chairs because he was leaving the lounge soon afterwards. We had a gin & tonic and there seemed to be plenty of food although we were already full from the earlier flight. We found it difficult to understand why a business class lounge, of that size, could be almost totally full - and that reception was still allowing more people to enter without seating to accommodate them. By midnight, many passengers had left and there was plenty of seating. Our overall opinion was that, as indicated in the title, our experience was good but not very good, however there isn't an option for that on a 5-point scale. We certainly benefitted from the upgrade but at a cost equal to another holiday.",3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,TripAdvisor

The aircraft from CPT-Addis was a lot older and 'slightly overused inside' versus the aircraft from Addis to FR; however, it was still pleasant. The food was particularly below average on all flights, which I would highly suggest they review and change. The seats were comfortable and screens worked fine with adequate listings to view...its not Emirates, but it fills the void for screen time. My colleague had an issue with her audio that wasnt a highlight of course. The staff were pleasant, with very friendly and helpful hostesses on the flight from Addis to FR. Toilets were clean and adequate-I assume this differs between flights, I guess we were lucky with fellow travellers. And lastly, the Addis airport is actually pretty cool and no different to other airports in terms of people etc. You can get bottled water, something to snack on and relieve yourself at decent ablution facilities.

Nov,2019.0,Good value and reliable service.,Edinburgh,Lilongwe International Economy,Ethiopian Airways Edinburgh to Lilongwe There were three legs to this flight with the first leg being provided by Flybe from Edinburgh to Heathrow. Although the flight was on time and most aspects were as I would have hoped what I find really annoying is that the carry-on allowance for this leg of the flight is limited compared to the second two stages of the flight. I have found that over the last few years the quality of service provided by Ethiopian Airways has continued to improve while costs appear to have reduced. (November 2019 £752.05) They offer the same choice and quality of food as other carriers on this route and the in-flight entertainment is reasonable although do not expect up-to-date movies. When transiting at Heathrow and Addis Ababa arrival and departure was from the same terminal which makes things easier but do check this before departing. This is particularly helpful because on both the outward and inbound flights you have to collect boarding passes at Heathrow. Although the flights that I have taken have been quite busy the boarding process has been swift and sometimes completed ahead of schedule.

For our return trip, however, the first hint there was a problem was when the boarding passes wouldn't download, or email, or anything. On arrival at ADD it was chaotic, as the new terminal is built but the infrastructure isn't really in there yet. We had to go to the 'special requests' queue to get our boarding passes...eventually... So to the flight, which was ready on time, boarded in orderly fashion - one of the few airlines I have ever seen turn away 'chancers' who try and jump their boarding group number! We departed on time. It took ages for them to come and serve us breakfast, which given it was an 8.40 departure meant lots of hungry stomachs. And this was where we discovered that though the airline had picked up the special meal request for the outbound flights, and we had specifically checked it had been applied to all flights, that they didn't have our dietary need down. And tried to say breakfast was ""vegetarian"" when it had a (meat) sausage in the middle of it. A vegetarian meal was located, with ill grace, ""I know what's on my manifest"" (yeah, but your manifest is wrong, that's what is being pointed out to you), and duly served. When our main meal was served, about 90 minutes out from Heathrow, the same crew member did remember, and again found a ""spare"" meal.

I travelled by their latest DreamLiner for four segments of my itinerary (New Delhi-Addis-New Delhi, and Addis-Jo'burg-Addis). However, I find their food and drinks boring and repetitive.

However, the last time I booked a direct flight from Addis Ababa to Madrid I ended up having a 2 and 3 hours stop in Cairo and Rome even though my flight was purchased as direct. The worst part is that I found out about these changes once I was on the plane because they did not even have the courtesy to inform via email. I consequently arrived late to my destination both times. The other thing to highlight is their food. After trying their menu once (they normally offer the same s**)and getting sick, I decided not to eat their food anymore.

The check in process was quick and easy, the crew was polite, the food decent and the online entertainment system on the 787 on the first leg from Chicago to Addis Ababa was great. The airport in Addis Ababa is undergoing work, but it needs major work. Most of the international planes arrive in the morning and the best way to describe the process is organized chaos. You plane and deplane via stairs on the tarmac. A shuttle takes you to the main airport where all connecting passengers have to go through security again. The airport itself needs work as the bathrooms could not accommodate the crowds, there were no areas to get food/water, and few seats. Still, Ethiopian airlines runs a very efficient system getting people to and from the planes, etc. Would fly them again to Africa.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Dec,2019.0,Awful experience for a disabled passenger,London,Cape Town Central International Economy,"When traveling we always call ahead to be moved into the bulk head seats as my husband has a spinal cord injury with a fused spine and needs the extra leg room to be able to stretch out in order to not get spasms and shake painfully throughout the flight which would be of discomfort to himself and other passengers. The bulk head seats as per all airlines and written on Ethiopian Airlines website are reserved for passengers with these types of needs who require them, all that's needed is a phone call to customer services 24 hours before the flight. To be safe, we called 2 months before and we were told that they can't do anything over the phone, we need to call closer to the time. We called 2 weeks before and we were told that we need to do this at the airport when checking in on the day. To be sure, we called 24 hours before checking and we were told that we need to be at the airport 24 hours before. Sorry WHAT?!?! So we arrived at the airport 5 hours prior to check in, 8 hours before boarding, only to be told that they can't do anything now. We eventually had the seats moved around and we got the extra legroom we needed for medical reasons, however when boarding the second leg of the flight the seat we had booked ended up not being a bulk head seat. Drama all over again. Can I just mention that they also lost my husbands wheelchair after the first leg so he didn't have it brought to him in the layover as requested which meant that he couldn't move around independently or use the restroom. We were also left on the flight for 45 minutes after all other passengers had departed, with no explanation. After the journey we emailed customer services and got an apology and an assurance that for our return flight our bulk head seats have been booked all the way through. When leaving Cape Town we were told at the airport that this has only been sorted for one flight and not the second. Does my husband suddenly not have an injury and the need for space halfway through our journey?? The Ethiopian Airlines manager made a point to say that we had done everything wrong (even though we had literally done what their website and colleagues over the phone had advised and well in advance), that I was brought to tears. Because of the awful experience, when boarding in Cape Town to return to London we were told that as an apology we would get a business class upgrade but only for the second leg of the journey because the first leg was full. However when boarding the second leg, the manager in Addis hadn't checked his email and only when we told him what was arranged he checked and saw that we were to be upgraded. (this is 8 hours since receiving the email). Obviously then he had already sold the business class seats so no upgrade for us AND NO BULK HEAD SEATS. When emailing the airline for an explanation after arriving back home, we received no apology, no explanation and no promise of further training their staff on customers needs. All we got was 50% off our next flight in economy so that they can keep their reputation. And what, go through all this again? No thanks!",2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Dec,2019.0,The longest flight.,Dar es Salaam,Manila International Business Class,"We normally use Qatar Airways, Emirates when going to Asia, Philippines that is for the comfort and the lounges before connecting. This time, we tried the Ethiopian Airlines business class( cheaper than the two airlines and shorter flight). Dar to addis was comfortable, very few passengers so we could enjoy the whole place. Then landing in addis the nightmares start, the security check where other passengers don’t even have a clue how to fall inline together with their bags and bags of whatever, I thought each passenger have to have either one or two bags hand carry but these people they are hauling the whole supermarket. The staffs at the security checks are overwhelmed with these rowdy passengers. Then the cloud nine lounge, wow what a mess, overcrowded( flying midnight) so I get it, it’s rush hour. I think you modernize your toilets. Food, we didn’t eat anything just drank some water. The connecting flight to Manila, at the gate it took them sometime to open it on time, so another wait. Business class was full, though I have to say for 14 hours flight choosing business class is a must, it was comfortable, staffs are friendly and accommodating, we were lucky not to have rowdy passengers. The only problem is the food, well I have to eat right it’s a long flight, I don’t normally eat airline food. So two hours after landing in Manila, diarrhea and vomiting, very unpleasant experience. I guess, you really have to be careful with the food they serve. Coming back, the same thing, I had the whole Hongkong to Addis upset stomach, I should have learned and not eat at all.. Now landing again in addis, this time not crowded at all. The lounge was not crowded early morning. Landing in Dar es Salaam came the problem,the ground staffs leading to the security check racial profiled us, the white lady passenger who was with us was not asked to show her yellow fever vaccination card at all,she’s even a tourist still have to apply for a visa. But us, even stopped us for sometime reading our yellow fever vaccination cards as if they are fake( we’re expats travelled the world with so many vaccines given by real doctors both from Europe, Asia,Kenya etc...) this ground staff lady has no clue at all it’s because we are Asians, she’s very racist. In Kenya and Ethiopia we’ve never been treated this way,only in Tanzania airport. At the immigration, was ok, with our residents visas. Then the suitcases came 45mins after landing. Well, business or economy class, the same. If it’s not for the comfort of the seats I would not waste money flying business they treat you the same because I’m Asian, it’s only in Tanzania, I have felt that. Talking about racism there you go. Yes, I’m ranting here, I’m supposed to only review the airline but yes, that was our experience here in this part of the world.

Dec,2019.0,"Good fly staff, food is decent, seats comfortable - lost luggage",Addis Ababa,Entebbe Africa Business Class,"Ethiopian Airlines provides newer planes, comfortable seats, and a kind competent staff, but only fair food, and on our flight, only one working bathroom. A second business class bathroom was out of order. But the real issue is that we paid for business class seats to ensure we would be provided services that are often taken for granted, in the expectation that – as experienced fliers – problems will occur. We were on an 8-day aid mission to Uganda starting December 16 and there were long dusty days ahead when we landed. As we expected…of the three bags we checked in for the two hour flight from Addis Ababa to Entebbe, somehow only two bags came out of the conveyor belt. Not only did the airline lose his luggage, which took hours to curate and spray with insecticide to avoid malaria on our rural journey, but we counted seven others in the cramped luggage services office filling out lost luggage forms on the same flight. We stayed three more hours at the Entebbe airport for the next flight, thinking it might have been delayed, but it wasn’t on the flight either. And after four calls over the next two days, there was no sign of the bag and we had to move on. Needless to say, luggage services at the Entebbe airport (run by contractor NAS for all airlines servicing the airport) was quite unconcerned about out loss. There is no automation to record luggage inventory, everything is done manually in multiple ledger books, and research takes a lot of time. We completed our challenging journey with a group of 20 others, changing hotels every day and visiting gorgeous vistas contrasted with dirt poor poverty throughout the country. Upon return to the capital city, Kampala, we checked with NAS and were told that the luggage had been found and was being held at the airport. But we arrived at the airport (5 hrs earlier than our return flight because we know they are incompetent) to find that the luggage indeed been found after five days but then sent to our first hotel in Kampala, two hours away. We received delivery of the bag to our flight with 15 minutes to spare before boarding. Total time spent waiting to track lost luggage? 5 hours. So to recap we arrived / landed in Entebbe, Uganda on Dec 14 and received our luggage on Dec 23 just in time for our trip back to USA... (so all new clothes had to be acquired for the rural trekking in Uganda.) yes we did file a clein and will wait to see if it is honored for the expense of the clothing . The wasted time cannot be repaid. Wonder what it’s like for economy customers ? PS.

Service was curt and occasionally rude and sometimes racist - during a layover I was filling in an immigration card that had been handed out and a flight attendant walked over, closed my table without asking and then told me there would be 'plenty of time later' to fill in my card later. Why hand out the cards so then??? A number of times when I got up to use the washroom or to get something to drink I was shooed back to my seat - why treat paying customers this way? The food was abysmal - the most processed food I've ever eaten on a flight. I asked for 'chicken' and received some meatballs tasking like styrofoam in goo and dry, rubbery pasta. This was served to us twice on a single flight! Seats were small and my neighbours were in my space for most of the flight. Entertainment system had very limited options. Boarding was chaotic because the flight attendants insisted on taking up most of the prime overhead storage space for their large carry-ons and then leaving it for the passengers to fight it out over the remaining space.

My siblings traveled with Ethiopian Airlines to Ghana only to realize upon landing that none of their bags made it. As frustrating and disappointing that is, we took it in stride and set out to start the arduous, often frustrating process to find the bags. Staff at Ethiopian Airlines proceeded to give us the run-around, it was a relay race of person after person passing the buck with no one giving as a straight answer or being helpful in any way. After spending 6 hours talking to 8 different people from different countries we still don't know where the bags are and not a single person we spoke yo has been helpful about getting the bags to their final destination. All that is frustrating enough, but what led me to write this review is the customer service we received from the staff in New Jersey. They were rude, talking over us, and yelling. Then they proceeded to disconnect the phone while we were still talking. The guy on the phone did call back after to ask for the bag numbers, but the rudeness on the phone was uncalled for and disrespectful.

They also had a nice cabin with comfortable seats, and there was a new stream to your device entertainment system. However, it's a shame that such a great airline is saddled by such a terrible hub airport like Addis Ababa, which is currently undergoing a renovation that doesn't seem to have changed the problem of congestion and lack of jetbridges. Luckily, this flight departed in the afternoon, as Addis Ababa gets even crazier during the late night hub hours. Boarding was chaotic, which is the norm on Ethiopian, but the arrivals process at NBO was actually decent, as Ethiopian uses Kenya Airways' much more modern wing of the airport for arrivals.

Despite having queued for 2.5 hours at check in and the a further four house at the ticket desk, we were whittled off to a hotel for the night and promised to be on the next days plane. Things happen and generally accepted it up to this point. Arrived at airport next day and only ticketed to Addis but promised when we get to Addis would get onward ticket there as they could not issue in CPT. Didn't not believe as need an aisle seat and so was apprehensive. Also informed $300 voucher only usable for a flight or could convert to $150 cash at Heathrow at the ticket desk upon arrival. Got to Addis no onward ticket and when squeezed on the flight told I had to have a middle seat -informed they would ask all passengers on boarding to see if someone would swap. I was fortunate that someone next to me would swap. Upon arrival at LHR went to ticket office and woman behind counter says we dont issue cash here you will need to call customer service - called customer service who said or you will need to email the London office to find our what to do.

Amenities were good and drinks were great. Cabin staff were nice and efficient but they do not kneel to speak to you and sometimes you do not hear what they say. They do not provide pyjamas.

I was travelling with my Mom in January and the service- or what they call it service- was unspeakable. The plane itself was dirty, the sets and the alley. Full of marks on the seats, no aircondition nd it was uncomfortably hot during the 8 hour flight from Addis Ababa. I was waiting 20 minutes for a glass of water and eventually had to get up from my seat to ask for one. All flight attendees were gathering in the alley with their tea/coffee having laughs and chats and when I asked for water I was told they have no time and I will get some when they will have time. This incident repeated 3 more times. Travelling with a disabled elderly parent is stressful enough and they have no compassion or manners for that matter. The food was inedible and everybody sent it back exactly the way it was dished. All crew was eating from the business class as I've seen it every time I had to get up to get a glass of water. I wanted to upgrade us to business class for our return flight, but the hassle with it is not worth it. I had to book another return flight with Emirates. I contacted their customer service team who only acknowledged my email and replied 2.5 months later. Apart from an apology of their late reply they didn't do anything.

Firstly Ethiopian operate out of Terminal 2, Heathrow which is a good terminal. The Ethiopian airline staff are excellent, the baggage allowance of 23kg x 2 per person is fantastic, the price of the flights is low and the leg room for economy is good and the seats comfortable and the cabin is clean. The entertainment was very good on 3 out of the 4 flights, (on return leg first plane didn't have any, but not huge issue as that was a shorter flight) and had plenty of choice. On the day I flew out the plane wasn't crowded either and coming back with my family was easy despite my children being 2 years, and 11 months. They are fantastic with children and boarding is easy with them. Food choice was good too as a vegetarian they are very accommodating. Using Ethiopian meant the transfer was in Ethiopia rather than Kenya or Amsterdam and the new airport extension has literally just opened so it is beautiful to use for connections and the food choice there is great and free internet that works well too.

Jan,2020.0,A very pleasant experience,New Delhi,Addis Ababa International Economy,"This was a Dreamliner, a fancy plane with ‘mood lighting’ to help you adjust to the time zones you travel through, fairly spacious seats even in cattle class (in terms of leg room, this is one of the best I’ve been in). We were travelling with our six year old daughter, and the stewardess made friends with her at the entrance itself! Pillows in fresh new pillow slips, thin blankets in sealed covers, headphones, and the in-flight magazine had our child overjoyed, until she discovered the in-flight entertainment, which is pretty comprehensive: movies, TV, games, apps and more, in various languages. Even the flight safety instructions video is a creative one, cute and fun at the same time as it’s informative. The flight to Addis Ababa is a six-hour haul from Delhi, and less than an hour into the flight, snacks were brought around. A little packaged savoury snack, looking like tiny doughnuts, was unimpressive, but my glass of passionfruit juice was lovely. They also offer liquor—later in the flight I had a tiny bottle of white wine. Barton & Guestier, not great but not terrible either. Lunch was a mix of surprisingly good and pretty indifferent. In the non-vegetarian meal, there was a choice between chicken and mutton, and I chose mutton. This came in the form of a mutton curry, served with plain steamed rice and a mild spinach dish, similar to a creamed spinach. With that was a roll (somewhat dry), butter, crackers, cheese (processed), and a salad of sliced cucumber, tomato and a wedge of lime with a sachet of dressing on the side. While the mutton curry was delicious, full of flavour but not horribly spicy, the dessert was a disappointment: it seemed like pink Miracle Whip, topped with a few toasted almonds slivers. I had a few bites, and couldn’t bring myself to eat any more. Service was adequate, efficient enough and accommodating of our child’s idiosyncrasies.the most pleasant surprise was that the stewardess brought our child a goodie bag after lunch: a delightful pouch containing a colouring set, a jigsaw puzzle, and a small stuffed toy.

Jan,2020.0,Acceptable carrier until you get denied boarding,Cape Town Central,Addis Ababa Africa Economy,"I flew Ethiopian during Christmas break from Addis to Cape Town and back. On my way back, the flight was highly overbooked, and around 10-15 people were denied boarding including me. I have the feeling they chose me because my flight was only to Addis, and since this destination does not belong to the EU or US, there's no legal costumer protection which means that one is dependent on the service by the Airline. The 'service' is as follows: They offered me a hotel 50 kms outside of Cape Town, in an area so remote that I would not want to spend the night there. I urged for a hotel in Cape Town itself, but they could not offer me this. I decided to not accept the hotel, but was not given any compensation for this. The only real compensation they offered me was a 300 dollar voucher for a next flight (which I wouldn't want after this experience), which turned out to be only 150 dollar if I wanted to have it cash. In Cape Town they told me I could get the cash on my arrival in Addis. After being sent to three different counters at Addis airport, it turned out I had to get the money in one of the ticket offices in town. I visited two of those, none of which had any dollars at that time. I only got my 150 dollar compensation at the third ticket office. Ethiopian pretends to be the best Airline in Africa, but in my opinion doesn't deserve this title at all. That there is no legal protection for overbooked passengers does not mean the company should treat denied passengers like this. 150 dollars was not enough to cover my extra expenses for taxi's and another night in Cape Town - not even to mention the lost opportunities I had because of my delayed flight.",1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

The one with the rounded seat configuration is better because the seat becomes real flat-bed with plenty foot area, the rectangular seat configuration is not real flat and the leg area is much crowded. Amenities were good and drinks were great. Cabin staff were nice and efficient but they do not kneel to speak to you and sometimes you do not hear what they say. They do not provide pijamas. Food was very good, but they serve only one serving and coffee and chocolate before arrival. IFE was good with selection of movies from various cultures.

Our flight has been delayed by 4 hours with no updates on why or what will happen next and were not even allowed to go outside even though we have South African Passports! This, after the air hostesses were shouting ""this is an emergency, sit down, sit down"" on the airplane causing everyone to panic.

I asked to check us in and the lady promised to do so and even gave us the seat numbers. When we arrived to the airport in Mekele it turned out that she has not checked us in and we had seats under the wing :( One more strange thing about Ethiopian airlines: if you are from Ethiopia or have Ethiopian ID, the ticket price will be cheaper, if you buy it online.

I was in transit in Addis and the kids were held back in Bujumbura due to bad weather conditions instead of landing in Kigali as planned, I understand a flight not reaching its destination but I don't understand why the company chose to withhold this information especially from a parent or give me the wrong info altogether, I cannot tell you how much panic this misinformation caused. The ground staff acted like we the clients were bothering them every time we asked for information. I asked a lady if she could make a simple phone call to their office in Kigali or to immigration to at least confirm if their passports had been recorded in the system and I wasn't granted even that.

Feb,2020.0,7 flights and fully satisfied,Mekele,Khartoum,"Mekele to Khartoum via Addis Ababa. Total of 7 flights and fully satisfied. During a long trip around Ethiopia we flew Ethiopian 7 times, 6 times on domestic routes and once internationally. Five of those flights were between 40-50 minutes, and even so, we got a snack (pound cake) and a soft drink - if there is any time left you can even ask for a hot coffee. One flight was slightly late, the night before Timkat we were flying to Gondar and it seems that due to huge volume they changed our plane, so there was some confusion at the gate. Furthermore, once on board, there was a technical issue - all in all we were about 2 hrs late taking off, made up half an hour and arrived 1.5 hr late in Gondar. During the waiting time the crew served refreshing drinks and all was calm. The international flight was 1.5 hr long, to Sudan, and once on board the engines were off and there was no A/C, which, however, meant that some nervous passengers started harassing the crew insisting they get them complaint forms during take off! It was quite annoying and unnecessary because once the engines were on the temperature went down so much I needed my jacket. Anyway, some people just like to complain. Every time our bags made it to the airport, even when we had very, very short connections between two Ethiopian flights. During the flight from Lalibela, the plane was waiting for several people who lazily strolled the tarmac to the plane (both Ethiopians and tourists), while the rest of us nervously waited with our short connections in mind. However, at ADD, where we made connections, the second flight waited for us, so we ultimately made it to our final destination, our bags included. All in all, we could not be happier with our Ethiopian experience and wish them best of luck in their ambitious plans for the future.",5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,AirlineQuality

Feb,2020.0,Good in parts -- shambolic in others,Addis Ababa,London International Economy,"We did a round trip from London to Addis Ababa, with a further three internal flights in Ethiopia (which were pretty cheap add-ons). Once on the planes, they're pretty standard, and reminded me of how European flights were 20 years ago -- cabin staff running round to hand out drinks and snacks on even the shortest flights. Movie choices on intercontinental flights were a bit B-grade, but economy-class catering was pretty reasonable. Lots of confusion, delays, and general chaos at all the local airports -- well, actually, at Addis Ababa Bole, too -- but hey, this is Africa. The real problem came when I tried to check-in on-line the day before my return flight to London, scheduled early on a Sunday. That went smoothly, except that I was assigned a seat on a Monday flight. Eh what? The only practical way to resolve this, late on Saturday night, was to go in person to the EA desk at their flagship hotel, the Ethiopian Skylight. All they could do there was to confirm that my flight had been cancelled, for reasons that are still unexplained to this day (though I strongly suspect that it may've been simply because of light loading). At this point you'd think they could've just issued a hotel voucher for the additional night that I was now forced to stay; but no. Even though my flight had been cancelled, I was *required* still to go to the airport at the crack of dawn the next day, and not(!) check in, before they would give me the voucher! How barmy is that? And I have to say, too, that the hotel they put me up in, the Debredamo, is a real dump. Check out the TA reviews -- at the time of writing, it's ranked ""#128 of 166 Hotels in Addis Ababa"".

Of course if you find a promo ticket, 50% less than normal price,as we did, risk it. Service and aircrafts are medium.

After hours of holding on the phone (literally 2 hours to solve 1 issue), the response is that they will email you back with confirmation. I NEVER received the email and then am forced to start the 2 hour process over again with a different representative the next day. IF you have to change a flight, the airline's website tells you to call them. Flight changes on their service line are nearly double the fare from what's listed online. Their operations include unethical business practices and unclear policies. Do NOT book with them. I fly 100k miles a year and this was my biggest travel mistake of all time - never will I ever book with them again. Ethiopian Airlines is so money hungry that they continue to operate flights to/from China during the coronavirus outbreak.

Feb,2020.0,London-Addis-Jimma,London,Jimma International Economy,"I took this flight for the convenience and the luggage allowances. I agree with some of the negative comments about the In-flight service and in Addis if you going to get a domestic flight your luggage may not be getting delivered to final destination because in Addis sometime the custom holds your luggage back, and if you do not get a call or just go and check if they have come down the carousel, if not they get loaded on to the connecting flight. Its annoying as one of my luggage took five days to get it sent to Jimma because of custom in Addis want to charge duty for my personnel electrical item. They will waste lot of time and the airliner is powerless do anything to get your luggage off customs. Be aware of electrical items which they may charge duty but not much and also may delay getting your luggage back. Ground staff in Addis not very good for international passengers as they send you around in circle stupidly. As to the visa, please try to get it online rather than at the airport. Main terminal to terminal 1 there is shuttle service by Ethiopian airline but not many people aware off it and walks to the terminal 1, and its a long walk. Jimma ground staff manager Beniyam is very good and very intellectual person he should be promoted in dealing with customer service, and he was so helpful to get my luggage and also re-booked my ticket back to London as I wanted to come back a week earlier, all other staffs. All other staffs I cannot say much, but in Addis one of the check in staff almost made me miss my connecting flight because of my hand luggage was too big for her eyes, but it was not and I was checked in from london all the way.and had no issues. She wanted to charge for my hand luggage when I was trying to find my way to the connecting flight and she held on to my boarding card for a while unless I pay for it, but it was all a waste of time at the end, and she had to give my boarding card back. Ethiopian airline fly to so many places than most African or in fact Asian countries but ground staffs needs lot of training plus cabin crew. Food on board was cold and watery and not tasty at all i must say. On-board wifi is good which you pay for it, which is not much. Take off and landing seems punctual and very good generous luggage allowances. Ticket are reasonably priced. I am frequent flyer to most other destinations around the world but I found Addis airport even it is expanding and busy airport but ground handling and information points etc are very poor. I am a experience traveler and i some how get by but for less experience and elderly there is not much help I can see a around.

Crackers, side of sour couscous, butter, cheese & some runny yellow pudding for dessert. This high in carb meal lacks flavor & nutrients. Even though tickets are competitive with others Ethiopian airlines offers lower standard service.

When I arrived at ADD, I contacted with the ticketing officers. They provided me accommodation for 1 night, but I have several problems: 1) I also need my luggage. For 1 night, I have to clean up myself. Everything is inside the luggage. I have to wait for 2 hours minimum. 2) I don’t know how to go to the hotel. I am not a local person here. They cannot give me or take me to the bus. 3) I waited for 6 hours at JFK and also I have to wait my luggage for 2 hours. Overall, it is not my mistakes. It is the airline’s mistakes. Finally, I fly with the business class and what I need. I expected that I could have more comforts and faster services. Totally, I spent my time for 1 day and a half for waiting stupid things. Last two years, I flew with Airasina Airline. The flight was delayed by 3 hours. The staffs changed the tickets since I was a check-in counter at JFK. Also, they offered a hotel accommodation, but they waited me at the boarding gate when I arrived at the transit airport. They lead me to the hotel shuttle bus. I don’t understand why Ethiopian airline has the service standards that is completely lower than other star alliance airlines. I have a lot of thing to to after I arrive my home.

My Wife was in SA when the Lockdown was announced - Virgin summarily cancelled her return flight (am STILL waiting to hear from them re getting back here, even though she has been home for a month) To get back she bought a ticket with Ethiopian Airlines, via Addis Ababa. The flight was great, good service, excellent planes and staff and a pleasant flight all round. Down side was that her suitcase didn't arrive - it wasn't put onto the plane in Johannesburg. Having notified the powers that be at Heathrow - with NO success, I wrote to Ethiopian Airlines directly. Immediate response from the highest level and a string of follow up emails over the next couple of weeks, she received a call yesterday to say that her case was waiting at Heathrow. We went down to collect it immediately - as per normal at Johannesburg International, her wrapped suitcase had been opened, the stitching slit and her case rifled through. Fortunately the low life that got in there didn't find anything as he didn't unzip the top compartment. I have the utmost respect for the way in which Ethiopian Airlines assisted us with the return of the case. Brilliant service.

Despite several attempts to contact the airline locally, we were unsuccessful. Finally after a long, expensive wait, we contacted the call centre in Ethiopia. We were informed that the flight had not been cancelled but as the airline was not allowed to land, there would be no flight. The airline was offering a travel voucher and cancellation with a refund was available with a cancellation fee of USD150 and a no show fee of USD50 with no refund. The difference in airfare would be payable when the voucher was to be used, if applicable. On 27 March we received email notifications for each leg of the flight that the flights were cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. While it is understandable that the airline would not want to lose money, Ethiopian Airlines are using coercion. Customers have no control over changed flight prices at the point of flying after COVID-19. So if one opted for the travel voucher, a customer may have to pay more for a ticket. Should one opt to cancel, the customer would have to pay USD150. The fair position would be to either refund the customer with no penalties, as it is not the customer’s fault, or to offer the voucher with an assurance that there will be no price difference to be paid later.",3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,AirlineQuality

Mar,2020.0,Good airline with good service,Manzini,Accra Africa Economy,"I flew on Ethiopian airlines this year from Manzini Swaziland to Accra Ghana. Initially I was booked on Airlink from Manzini to Johannesburg and South African Airways from Johannesburg to Accra, but due to COVID-19 SAA stopped all their flights on the very day I was supposed to travel. I was kinda stranded for a bit with only a ticket to Johannesburg and since I didn't have a Visa in South Africa I wouldn't have been allowed to board the flight to later on become stranded in OR Tambo Airport. So at the last minute I was booked on Ethiopian airlines from Johannesburg to Addis Ababa that night and from Addis Ababa to Accra the next morning. Might I say that my Jobrug-Addis flight was particularly good even though it was full, at first I thought I was to fly 737-800 but that night I flew the dreamliner dash 8 and the food as well as the IFE and the legroom was very good howbeit the flight attendants were a bit stressed given that this was the last flight out of OR Tambo and the pandemic was changing a lot of things in their lives, so I understood. I arrived around 5am at Bole the next morning and was surprised to be quickly whisked through security and customs (most people complain of the congestion at Bole) and I had about a 3 hour layover. Then I boarded my flight to Accra which was an a350-900 and this flight came with the added advantage of free WiFI howbeit limited to WhatsApp and only for an hour unless one intended to pay. The food was great again, the IFE and seating was the same as the dreamliner but the flight was slightly better due to less people on board and the service was on time and good. I arrived in Accra safely (which was actually the last flight before the airport started quarantine) and I just headed home to my family. All in all I was impressed with Ethiopian airlines and their service given the chaotic circumstances at the time and I really like their fleet which includes newer aircraft until with SAA which still uses the older a340s (actually I was booked on an a330-300 that night from Joburg to Accra). And the service is way better than SAA as well as the quality of food, I will definitely fly them again ! PS. I never got my refund from SAA for my ticket as they have collapsed now in bankruptcy and I probably will not get it back.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

I was told we could only get vouchers. I’m not going to spend thousands of dollars on an airline not on my continent, and uncertain if we will be able to reschedule the trip. Moral of story - 1 month prior to our trip I finally got an email saying my flight was officially cancelled. I called to request refund, told they only gave vouchers.... once again referred to the DOT release from April stating they were obligated to refund our tickets even if it was due to pandemic.... asked to speak to manager... told a refund would take 3+ months.... said that’s just fine. Waited 40 minutes.... told they would process refund.... told them I’d wait for confirmation email..... 3 days later it was back on my credit card I will NEVER book with them again. Even when we reschedule our trip for November or future, I will pay more for other flights from other airlines. Worst experience I have ever had with customer service. Demand your money back, eventually they will give it. They are fully aware of the DOT statement, they quoted it to me. That’s your only hope of getting a refund.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

However, Veronica proved me wrong - she was extremely helpful and accommodating. I explained to her that my mom needed a seat with enough leg space, and she not only found her a front row seat, but also for my dad (Every time we request this during booking, we would be told that it will be taken care of, but it never does). After receiving our boarding passes, I returned back to her to add my parent's sheba miles to their ticket, and she graciously did it with a smile. She is an example of what an excellent customer service is like. I wish all of ET employees learn from her, and she undoubtedly deserves praise and additional compensation for her outstanding service, and efforts to improve the image of Ethiopian airlines.

Jul,2020.0,no hot towel served. No menu,Frankfurt,Addis Ababa,"Frankfurt to Addis Abba on 05th July 2020. I had originally booked an economy class seat, but decided to upgrade to Cloud Nine as I wanted to relax and enjoy my flight in comfort.The check-in gentleman in Frankfurt was friendly and processed my $580 upgrade fee. No mention was made about any change in onboard service. I was directed to the Senator lounge at Frankfurt airport where I was horrified to find every single business class passenger flying that evening, attempting to squeeze in the few seats available. If the other lounges in Frankfurt are closed due to Covid-19, then having masses of people cramming into one lounge is a major mistake, as it puts a large number of people crammed together into one small lounge. Rather have several lounges open with a limited restriction on number of guests allowed at a time. Boarding went smoothly. The seat on the 787 was as expected. Comfortable, but unfortunately that is where the pleasant onboard experience ended. I realise that there may be concerns of the Covid-19 virus and how to handle on-board service, but I had just flown on a Lufthansa connecting flight from Lisbon, and i was given the full Business class experience as normal. Firstly, no hot towel served. No menu. Inflight entertainment not working. Seat charging ports not working. Economy class tray and food served in business class. Shocking quality of food for business class. Breakfast was cold and severed in a economy class tray and I found out it was the same meal offered in economy class! Toilet behind seat 5L, not flushing. Crew did not wear gloves at any time during service. How is Ethiopian Airlines charging me a full upgrade cost when the product I am receiving is not business class in any way. Only the seat was business class. Nothing was mentioned about the lack of service onboard this flight. They offer business class as a whole experience and product. I tried to call their global customer service number in Addis Abba and waited for over 6 hours on hold before the calls being cut off! They said they i was ""Next in line"" to be answered for over two hours! each time. It is wrong to use the Covid-19 threat to still charge business class fares but bring down the level and items served in this class. If you want to cut services offered then you should cut the cost of the business class fares to reflect this.",4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

Jul,2020.0,DO NOT FLY WITH ETHIOPIAN,Houston,Lagos International Business Class,"I would give them zero stars, literally..I flew with business class and here is how the experience was: 1) their systems did not work, so check in took me 2 hours despite flying with business class, and they offered no sympathy or explanation whatsoever, which brings me to my second point 2) bad customer service. I have flown on airlines like Swiss, Lufthansa, KLM, Emirates and Qatar. When you fly these airlines, you see what good customer service is. Everyone from those at the check in counter, to the flight attendants had horrible customer service, despite me being in business class. I can’t imagine how they are to people in economy 3) Our flight was delayed by 4 hours due to their bad check in systems (I guess their computers were down), but they kept us waiting in the airplane for 4 hours without the air conditioning on. Let that sink in, 4hours, we all had masks on due to COVID, stuck in the plane for 4 hours 4) as if that wasn’t enough, when we finally took off, it turns out that the TVs they had were just to decorate the plane, because the TVs did not work the entire flight. No TVs for a 12 hour flight from IAH to LOS, in business class. Also, look at the terrible looking seat in my attached picture, I wiped down my seat handles and they looked like I put the wipe in a bucket of sand. You would expect an airline making $3,000 for a one-way business class ticket Would be able to keep the plane clean... 5) finally, we arrive at the destination and my luggage’s which should be priority as I was in business class came out about 20minutes after some non-priority bags came out. Weird considering I paid $3,000 for my flight 6) overall, please spare yourself the trouble, and use an European or Asian airline. People warned me not to use Ethiopian but as a Nigerian, I thought I should give them a try. Obviously, it turned out to be a horrible flying experience.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Echoing the statements of others, their customer service is nonexistent and if you're calling about a refund, don't bother.

Case in point: Ethiopian changed the date of travel and in that circumstance, you're entitled to a full cash refund. No matter how many times I've spoken with them, they will not process refunds under ANY circumstance. To those affected by these idiots, don't despair. People have long memories and as a collective, stuff like this will never be forgotten. They won't survive this crisis and given the choice, I'd rather ride a donkey for 40 days to my destination than get on board an Ethiopian flight.

The flight was smooth with no turbulence alhamdulilah. Dinner was served. It was chicken with boiled rice amongst other little snacks. The only palatable thing was the chocolate mousse. I repeatedly asked the steward if the food was halal but he didn’t give a definite answer. The rice was bland so were the vegetables. soon I slept and was woken abruptly by the stewardess giving out snacks. Other airlines I fly with are much more gentle in this situation. The food made me sick to the stomach and for 2 days I couldn’t eat or smell a thing without throwing it up. I spent 8 hours transit in Addis Ababa airport and was promised a hotel to stay in.

Sep,2020.0,My trip lasted a total of 21 hours,Nairobi,Athens,"I had booked my ticket from Nairobi to Athens via Addis Ababa and the airline cancelled my scheduled flight due to COVID. When the airline resumed flights and I went to change my ticket, I was informed that the price had gone up (to double in fact) and even though it was a ticket I had already paid for, I had to pay for it again. 24 hours before departure I tried to check in online, but only the first part of my flight was available for check in. When I arrived at the airport ET had cancelled my flight from Addis to Athens, without notifying me, and had also booked me to fly 24 hours later, meaning I had to spend a day in Addis and arrive to my destination with 36 hours delay. The only way for me to reach my destination on the day i had planned (which was important) was to fly via Rome, adding 9 hours to my trip, and a lot more risk of contracting COVID, as i had to wait for hours at the airport and later fly with a plane that for some reason was crowded in the front half, while the second half remained empty. My trip lasted a total of 21 hours, and cost 1100$. My husband flew a day later with Lufthansa, and was there 12 hours later, having paid 600$. when I complained about this and requested to be refunded the difference I paid, someone replied 'Please kindly note that whenever schedule change or routing change occur we understand as our passengers’ plan may be disrupted but sometimes such decisions are necessitated due to operational or unforeseen circumstances'. After having flown with this airline a few times, I have come to the conclusion that it's ok to fly with them if if everything goes smoothly, but if something goes wrong and you need assistance and customer service, they become the worst.",2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

Nov,2020.0,The aircraft was exceptionally clean,Addis Ababa,London Heathrow,"Boarding was done efficiently – we were in zones and to prevent the inevitable attempts at queue-jumping staff were there to tell people to go to the back on the line. Masks were obligatory but social distancing was not. The aircraft was exceptionally clean and many of the seats in economy were empty – which is always a recipe for a pleasant flight. Toilets were clean. There was a broad selection of movies and the aircraft had decent screens. The only problem is that the controls are mounted in the arm rests which meant that occasionally the movie would freeze as your arms brushed against the panel. The flight was slightly delayed but arrived on time. Food was served promptly – a choice of beef or chicken with a roll, crackers, cheese and a biscuit. Although nothing special it was more than adequate. There was more wine if you asked. On landing at LHR there was the usual long walk at T2 and then delays at the eGates as passengers wondering why they were not working while they were wearing masks. The bags also took a long time to load onto the belt. Having flown on a 787 and then an A350 in quick succession, with identical seats, the latter would be my preferred aircraft: the flight seemed smoother and quieter and it simply felt better.

Nov,2020.0,a more pleasant journey than in pre-lockdown days,London,Addis Ababa,"Heathrow Airport is operating in lockdown mode and therefore check-in and security were very quick. Most of the restaurants were closed, although it was possible to buy some drink and food to be eaten on the chairs. Boarding the aircraft was done efficiently and it was about half full which meant that I had three seats to spread across. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The food was served in a box with a choice of chicken or beef. There was no problem with asking for another small bottle of wine or beer. We left on time and arrived slightly early. The aircraft was wi-fi equipped with one hour free access and a modest fee after that. The connection was remarkably fast. Given the price of this flight it offered great value and, with the lack of passengers at the airport and on the plane, was arguably a more pleasant journey than in pre-lockdown days.",4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,AirlineQuality
Nov,2020.0,Forget Social Distancing,Dubai,Tel Aviv,"Packed A359 from Dubai to Addis. Cabin temperature too warm, WiFI not working. Cabin crew very nice and attentive, meal was a typical C19 box with dry items and a hot casserole. Dry items were horrible, some small red beans salad in a sauce, bread hard as a rock. Crew apologized and brought a fresh bun. I guess ET assumes all their passengers like spicy food. Ethiopian proud itself on SAFE operation due C19, but on the ground they start boarding before the cabin is ready, so the jetway is packed, passengers on top of each other. Forget Social Distancing. Upon landing in Addis, passengers get up while the aircraft is still taxiing. Cabin crew tried to control the crowds, but to no avail. I forgot my BOSE headphones onboard,but trying to get assistance in the terminal was impossible. I was told “ to find an agent with a radio to call the plane”, but none had a radio. Our flight to Tel Aviv was delayed 3 hours du to some excuses about the ‘Air Space’ being closed in Ethiopia. That didn’t stop other flights to take off. Luckily we left after 3 hours (at 3am rather than 2355) Again that horrible box with spicy chicken, but we were all just happy to be out of Addis Ababa. Their cabin crew is the only good thing going for ET.",2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,AirlineQuality
Nov,2020.0,AVOID THIS AIRLINE. REFUSING REFUND AND PHONE STOLEN FROM LUGGAGE.,Juba,Johannesburg Africa Economy,"I booked and paid for seats with extra leg room. $60. I did not get that seat. I got the normal seat you don't pay extra for. The woman at check in told me that I would be entitled to a refund and that I would just need to contact them after the flight. Return flight then had the plane changed so I didn't get my seat then either. Same story I was told that is would get a refund. I have now been contacting them for almost a year and they have decided I am not due my refund despite them changing my seat. Not only that, when I boarded the plane there was no space for my hand luggage. So they took my bag down to checked luggage. When I arrived one staff went down to get my hand luggage as I had covid certificate in it. When I received the bag my phone was gone from the front pouch and the lock was broken. It was a samsonite new bag so not cheap and not weak. I have had ongoing issues with this company for several years tbh but always in a situation where they're the only airline at times flying between my work and home. From now on I will happily pay extra or wait longer to go with another airline rather than give them another penny. I hate thieves and scammers.

Nov,2020.0,check-in,Manchester,Khartoum International Economy,"one of the check-in advisors. I don't know the name of the adviser but she was the one managing the queue to direct customers which counter to go to. The flight was on 19/11/2020 from Manchester airport to Belgium. The people travelling were my wife and my two small kids, they were travelling on from Belgium to Ethiopia then to Khartoum. We arrived me and my family around 4:30 pm and because of cov19 the airport customer service were not going to allow me to enter the airport to assist my wife, however after they realised that she could not possibly manage all the luggage and the two small children alone, they let me enter with her to help check-in. We did the online check-in and we head to the counter to hand in our passport and weigh the luggage. The agent checked the passports and handed them back (no problem was identified with the passports or tickets) she asked us to put the luggage on the scale she found the luggage overweight one bag was 36kg and the other one was 34kg she said our regulation only allowed you to take 32kg. I asked for advice on what to do, she started to explain to me and then another agent interrupted her by shouting on her from the side in a very unprofessional manner. This other agent told the lady ""send them away"" I asked her why she was speaking to us like that and she kept shouting at me that she doesn't care. I explained that I had not travelled abroad from the UK before and I don't know the regulation, but she kept telling me she doesn't care, and the manner in which she spoke to me and my wife was so rude she did not try to offer any kind of way to resolve our problem. I felt really disgusted from her attitude, I left the queue to try to help my wife empty some of the luggage. I asked my wife to run to the car park to get an empty gym bag I started to take some items out the bags. I managed to reduce the weight of her bags and went straight back to the queue at that time there are two people in front of us in the queue and I left the two bags in the queue and walk 10 seconds away to get the remaining items Then when I came in this 10 seconds they decide the check-in is closed. The agent was shouting at us did not show any respect toward us, or show customer service. I told here I came from Glasgow which is 3 and a half hour driving and petrol money and my wife has go back to do another cov19 test because of her attitude. She replied she doesn't care. and believe she stopped my wife from checking in on purpose because of the situation a little earlier. There are two airport customer service they confirmed that she was rude to me and that the way she acted was not professional. She refused to provide her name to allow me to complain before leaving the airport. We left and rebooked another ticket which cost an extra £298 and the other ticket was for 24/11/20. My wife arrived and again the same agent was there. When she saw my wife and the two kids she recognised them and she went to the counter and talked to the other agent who was seeing to my wife. After she talked to the other agent the agent said the names are not correct on the tickets, last time they did not mention that so they ask my wife to pay £120 to get them changed. I am not happy with the way the agent treated me and my family and we all feel disgusted from the way she treated us. Thanks",4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

When I requested Ethiopian airlines to refund me for the flight portion I was refused to board, they denied and refused to assist.

When the time came for the flight they were refused boarding because they were booked to fly on another airline (a better airline) to fly back with me. When I contacted them by the online web phone they gave me a run around. First they told me that Brazil would not allow them entry. I informed them I was in Brazil and had made arrangements and confirmed with immigration about all the entry requirements before ordering a ticket. They then told me it was the airlines policy. I asked for a refund and to speak to a supervisor and was told both were not possible. I was told that it was the passengers responsibility to make sure entry requirements were met and they were so that story changed to it was the airlines policy and there is no where written that a return ticket needs to be purchased thorough them. When I asked where I could find this information I did not get any answer except I would need to use google. They then hung up on me.

Nov,2020.0,Unexpectedly Efficient cancellation process,London,Antananarivo International Economy,We were due to fly with Ethiopian airline to Madagascar this month but were informed of the flight cancellation 2 weeks in advance. Originally when I called I had a nightmare trying to get hold of someone as they would say they were unable to hear me due to issues on the line. They then said that that I would be charged a cancellation fee if the flight was cancelled due to government restrictions rather than the airline cancelling the trip and that I would need to wait up to 6 months for a refund. I was very annoyed at this point and sent an email to highlight my frustrations. Less than one week later I’ve received the full refund on my credit card - I did not expect a refund this quickly at all based on the current situation and people’s experience with other UK airlines.

Dec,2020.0,airline seems to do a very good job,Athens,Entebbe,"Online check in through the app very good. Luggage drop off in Athens, was a biut chaotic as there were a lot of people with excessive luggage on the counter line. The agents were very good though. The 1st flight was delayed more than an hour, however as I had almost 5 hours stop-over in Addis Ababa, this was not a problem. The flight was coming from Moscow and the majority of the passengers were from Russia. Almost full, however no-one next to me. Comfortable aircraft and seat and good food service (hot tasty meal). Cabin crew wear traditional Ethiopian dresses, which looks very nice and they are polite and nice, although strict regarding the wearing of masks (which they should be). Addis Ababa is a big hub, very busy in the morning that we arrived (although during covid times). A lot of aircraft arrive at the same time and many passengers have to catch connecting flights, this was done efficiently though. The airport is not particularly luxurious or extra comfortable, however not bad either. Would have preferred a shorter connection, however I knew about it when I booked it. The 2nd flight was on time, uneventful, another nice warm meal in a 2 hour flight. Landing smooth and collected luggage pretty quickly.

Dec,2020.0,Below average experience,Frankfurt,Windhoek International Economy,"The airplane from ADD to WDH has been changed on the last moment, my seat has been changed from 12A to 38A, which was very unexpected and disappointing, because I had to be picked up from Windhoek and brought to Swakopmund. I asked twice the crew to change the seat and they did not do it until I asked their team leader to come and explain the situation, why I could not be seated in the nose part of the plain. At the end they managed to find the place. Another point that should be addressed is the number of forms that passengers shall fill in before landing, so that they do not spend time doing it on the ground. Since my seat number has been changed, 1 out of 3 forms was finished. I assume, it is not difficult to count how many passengers on the plane and load the exact or even 10% more forms. I printed this form out at home, so did not have to get one from the crew. The last point is the serving. I asked for a coffee when the crew was serving for the first time. They said it will come with the next round. Actually, since I was alone on the row, they just skipped me and did not offer any coffee. I had to call them and asked for the second time.

Dec,2020.0,Awful Customer Service & Communication,Dubai,Addis Ababa International Economy,"Worst airline I have ever been on in all of my travels throughout the world. The website communications is super vague and hard to locate any helpful information. I tried to write a complaint through the webpage but I received a message saying it's unavailable, now over a week. Before I booked Ethiopian Airlines I saw this on the webpage about COVID-19 ""The safety, security and good health of our passengers and employees is our highest priority."" This was not the case on our flights. I felt very concerned for the health of my wife who is 5 months pregnant and myself. There was absolutely no social-distancing. Our first flight was overweight with luggage and we were delayed, after boarding the flight, for 1 hour and 30 minutes on the tarmac. Over half of the passengers on the flight were not wearing masks and many were walking around talking with people seated right next to us. The bathrooms were the filthiest I have ever experienced and not cleaned at all during the flight. Our trash from our meal was not picked up for over an hour after our meal. Once we arrived to the airport our luggage took over an hour to come out. I tried contacting the airline for over a week via email, their webpage chat, multiple phone numbers (with a call back option but never received a call back), and web complaint system all of these failed to work. During our trip we never received any information or email about where to get our PCR Covid-19 test. Dubai said they required it from a certain lab ICL so ICL booked our appointment for us. When we arrived for our appointment they refused us and said we must go to Ethiopian Airlines, even though they knew all our flight info when we booked. We had to go to Ethiopian Airlines Office which we finally found out through multiple phone calls, but we never received any of this information from Ethiopian Airlines. We spent a full day traveling around the city to find the testing location. Our return flight during COVID regulations on December 22, 2020 was overbooked. I asked customer service about our seats and social distancing and I was promised by a manager we would have an empty seat next to my wife for her safety. However that promise was not kept and the flight staff was not very kind or reasonable with us when we reminded them of this promise. This flight was not much better than our first, the bathrooms were still filthy and people were not wearing their masks. My biggest issue with Ethiopian Airlines is their significant lack of customer service and clarity to provide accurate helpful information.

Dec,2020.0,RACIST Pathetic Excuse for an airline and unworthy of their slogan! STAY AWAY!!!!!,Harare,London International Economy,"I have never been so appalled at an airline in my life. Below I have outlined my experience of Ethiopian airlines: Cabin Crew: Ethiopian airlines have a very female cabin crew as throughout my entire flight I did not see any male cabin crew. Perhaps it in not the fashion in Ethiopia to have male flight attendants. It would seem Ethiopian airlines is still behind the times with its patriarchal take on the sex of cabin crew. Furthermore, the airline appears to hire fair skinned Ethiopian women, rather than a diverse range of skin tones. This level racism became increasingly obvious as the flight progressed and we landed in addis abba were i noticed that the only dark skinned crew were the cleaners between connecting flights and in the airport cleaning toilets. Service: I appreciate that Zimbabwe does not have a functioning airline however it does not mean standards of other airlines flying to Zimbabwe should drop. On the return flight passengers were loaded onto a uncleaned aircraft from Robert Mugabe international airport to Lusaka international. Passengers had no access to clean headphones and it was evident that the pillows had not been changed. Not only as we are in a global pandemic that it is paramount to keep up cleanliness standards, but it is important that paying passengers are seated in a clean space. Only in Lusaka where cleaners allowed to board where they only cleaned the unoccupied seats. Those of us who were seated watching as we knew that where we sat had not been cleaned from the previous trip, I would like to know what possible justification EA has for this? On the return leg between Addis Ababa and London the aircrafts air conditioning was extremely cold and people in economy where evidently cold. Ethiopian did not provide blankets to be readily available and it was necessary to ask for these blankets. It was very difficult asking for a blanket as the crew were hostlie in giving one, especially as i had asked for two, one for my elderly aunt and another for my sister. They assumed i was trying to get two for myself and were very quick to shut me down. I couldn’t help look around and notice that we were all the sub Saharan Africans dark in complexion and felt maybe this poor treatment was something only reserved for us. When I asked for anything I thought as if I was begging as I asked for a second cup of tea due to how cold the cabin was. The service on our flight from London to Ethiopia was significantly better than the connecting flight from Ethiopia to Zambia and then Harare. However between London and Ethiopia cabin crew where very short and did not exhibit good customer service that you might expect when you have paid for your ticket. Cabin crew regularly pushed passed and aggressively leaned over passengers without the slightest courteous “excuse me”. Cabin Crew lacked the simple acknowledgment and respect that a human being was in their way let alone a paying customer It was though we had reverted to no more than cattle being transported. All levels of customer service grew more and more insincere as the flight progressed. Staff would say the correct things (call you sir), but would exhibit the body language of someone just wanting to get the job done and be over with. I couldn't help but think i was being discriminated against because i am a dark skinned African. Writing this i understand that there is a difference between first class, business and economy service however I believe that an airline should exhibit good customer service as a bare minimum throughout the classes. Food: the Ethiopian airlines economy menu seemed never stray from a chicken or beef option with a veg box consisting of a bun. Some type of salad and a dessert. This was acceptable, and the food generally was edible. The appearance of the food was not so pleasant in both settings and sometimes the food was inconsistently heated. Those of us who had the food all suffered from food poisoning. I pray the airline improves and takes note from its competitors Kenyan, Rwanda, SA who also run this leg. I will mot be flying with Ethiopian airlines again if I can help it. I think the additional £200 or so above the nominal ticket price for any other airline is with it.",4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Dec,2020.0,Ethiopian exceed expectations,Washington DC,Addis Ababa International Economy,"I had read reviews about Ethiopian Airlines that made me question whether I should use them for a flight from Dulles to Lusaka. But I also have done a lot of international travel and have learned to adjust my expectations based on a lot of factors. Last year my wife and I flew Emirates to Lusaka. $6,000-plus. This year we flew Ethiopian. $3,000, give or take. Ethiopian is somewhat like Southwest in the US. Compared to a lot of airlines that flew African routes prior to COVID, it was affordable to a lot more travelers, and still is. As a result planes are more likely to be filled with families and inexperienced travelers. That can led to some crying kids. But, that is not on the arline. As for Ethiopian Airlines, in a nutshell the flight crew service was very good, the plane was clean. The food was actually better than I have had in economy on pricier airlines. In flight entertainment is less that on pricier airlines, but mixed with eating, sleeping, reading it’s adequate. I have read reviews about flights on EA having filty restrooms. We did not experience that. Maybe it’s because we are flying in the COVID world but I observed crew santiizing and cleaning restrooms roughly every 90 minutes. In terms of COVID there was good mask compliance - a few violators here and there. On a plane social distancing was not possible. My wife and I wore KN95 masks in our seats and an additional plastic full-face covering during boarding and in the airports.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

The least we expect is a safe environment and an excellent service. An incident that made me rate this trip as TERRIBLE was due to one FA. Reprimanded me not just once but thrice about standing. If you are in an 11 hour straight flight, you need to get some good stretch and trips to comfort rooms once in a while. Encountered the FA telling me that I am not allowed to stand up due to COVID was way too dramatic. Social distancing cannot be practised inside the plane, for the flight was almost full. And this particular FA went back to me holding her Tab and wanted to lecture me about their manual for new covid measures....that all started from standing to que for the loo. A supervisor approached me, wanted to rectify the issue and was apologetic on behalf of her staff. Hands off to you Sup. Though the FA came to apologize, felt it was a bit less sincere. She did it for the sake of her Supervisor, who told her to say sorry to me.

Having slept on both within several days the old seemed more comfortable than the new. Boarding was quick and painless and I was quickly served with a glass of (almost) chilled champagne. Topping it up is always a nice touch. The cabin was very clean and the surfaces had clearly been wiped. The temperature was perfect throughout – warm enough for a good sleep. I opted for the fish and although it was served on a tray, it was on a dish with metal cutlery. It would have been nice to see a printed menu but I could understand why. The cabin and flight crew were meticulous in following covid rules and the toilets were kept spotless. One of the advantages of covid flying in near-empty business sections – and therefore less chance of being near a heavy snorer. There were occasionally bumpy patches but, unlike some airlines, the pilots did not resort to switching on the seat belt sign every time or leaving it on too long. There was really nothing that one could fault with this flight and, for the price and the timing, it offered excellent value for money. The only change the airline should make is offer business passengers free wifi.",5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,AirlineQuality
Jan,2021.0,Food was OK but not memorable,Dar es Salaam,Addis Ababa,Having received an email from the airline telling me I had to arrive at the airport FOUR hours before the flight I then waited an hour before staff arrived. They hadn’t a clue why we had received the email. Business passengers go through a separate entrance which I suspect was slower than the normal route. Two pleasant immigration officers spent an inordinate amount of time checking my exit form. The lounge was empty when I arrived except for the Ethiopian crew gorging themselves. The lounge has PIR-activated lights which kept on switching themselves off if no movement was detected. Equally annoying were the continual announcements that the country had banned the use an import of plastic bags in order to “save the environment”. All very worthy. Boarding was relatively quick with the ground crew insisting that everyone wore a mask. Again very encouraging – except many passengers had half-removed them before they reached the aircraft including a returning pilot sitting in business. The aircraft was a little worn but adequate. I received a warm glass of champagne but had to ask for it. Food was OK but not memorable. As we approached Addis I obediently complied with the cabin crew’s request to put my seat upright – but the pilot sitting in business evidently believed that the rule did not apply to her and remained reclined during landing.,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,AirlineQuality
Jan,2021.0,flight offered value for money,London,Addis Ababa,"Check-in at LHR was semi-chaotic with no distancing and a crush as passengers with huge amounts of baggage pushed their way through. There was no business priority lane. The only lounge open was Lufthansa’s uninspiring offering with beer or wine being served from a desk and a selection of food. Despite travel restrictions most LHR T2 travellers seemed to be retired couples. Boarding was slow with no priority for business but once on board it was a nice surprise to discover it had the new individualised seat layout. Cabin crew was quick to serve a glass of champagne and a refill. The movie selection was dire. Wi-Fi failed to connect to the satellite throughout the flight. The food choice was beef, chicken or fish and although it was served in a more premium economy style – a covid precaution – it was more than sufficient. The cabin crew was attentive in keeping my glass full. The flat bed was slightly narrow but not to extent that I was unable to sleep. Overall, this flight offered value for money and I arrived feeling relaxed.",4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,AirlineQuality
Jan,2021.0,cabin crew were efficient and pleasant,Addis Ababa,Dar es Salam,It was a nice surprise to find a 787 rather than a 737 that they often use on this route. Although it had an old-style side-by-side business seats the front of the plane almost empty and so it was not an issue. A glass of champagne was served very promptly and refilled – a nice trick other airlines should learn. The choice of food was limited to chicken or beef and I chose the former which came covid-style but with a pleasant couscous and prawn. There is no Wi-Fi on the aircraft and I did not check the movies. The cabin crew were efficient and pleasant.,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,AirlineQuality

They changed their policy then denied it. The most frustrating thing was that a refund was initially quoted and then retracted, plus two friends of mine on the same flight were issued a full refund.

Jan,2021.0,Ticket Agents Helpful - Phone Support Very Frustrating,Washington DC,Dar es Salaam International Economy,"My very long drama will be cut short if I simply stick to reviewing the customer service provided by ticket agents, telephone support and inflight amenties/staff. Purchased my flights (departing Charlotte, NC heading to Tanzania), but since EA has no presence in my neck of the woods, I had to connect via United from CLT to Dulles. The day before my flight I received a text from UA saying my flight was cancelled. That's where my frustration began. On the phone with EA customer support took so long - made several calls. Helpful tip: select SHEBA miles customer for a slighter shorter wait time. EA kept saying that I needed to contact UA about my cancelled flight, but UA said that I needed to connect with EA (since that's where I purchased my tickets). After several phone calls, UA finally indicated they were able to get me on an AA flight out of Charlotte. I arrive at CLT (airport) attempt to check in & the AA agent tells me I'm ""not on this flight"". Short version: I ended up purchasing airfare to get me from CLT to Reagan airport in D.C. (for an overnight stay, to then attempt to grab my original Dulles connection to Addis Ababa). In addition to the $147 for my one way ticket, I had to pay baggage fee for my carry on small backpack), I had to book a hotel for the night because my flight to the continent would leave the following morning, plus pay for Uber to get me from Reagan to the hotel (that night), plus an Uber for the next morning. I arrived at Dulles the following morning only to be told by the ticket agent at EA that (a) I wasn't on the flight to Addis (connecting to another flight in Ethiopia to Dar es Salaam), (b) EA wasn't responsible for correcting UA's issue & (c) a supervisor would need to help remedy my situation (said ""supervisor"" hadn't yet arrived. Short version here - the supervisor showed up, I shared with him all of my phone frustration, flight cancellation back & forth EA to UA with both claiming they weren't responsible, the extra cash I shelled out to arrive in D.C. for a connecting flight. Oh man !!! The supervisor was able to get me on the EA flight after speaking with UA. He gives me my boarding pass along with one for my EA flight from Addis to Dar. I ask him ""so, I'll have no issues getting on the flight from Addis to Dar?"" He confirms that it'll be fine and I have my boarding pass. I thank him for his efforts, along with the other agent (after all, they truly were patient with my dilemma & got me on the flight). 13 + hours later (mask & all), I land in Addis Ababa..chill out at the airport for a few hours until my flight is ready to board. At the gate, the EA agent takes my passport & boarding pass, checks in the system - then in a soft voice says ""miss, you're not booked on this flight"" At that point, all I could muster was a smile (at least I had safely arrived on the continent - Mama Africa had welcomed me). Eventually, the EA agent was able to get me a seat. Because of the UA - EA fiasco with my cancelled flight from Charlotte, I ended up arriving in Tanzania on 1 Jan, instead of 31 Dec....so I spent new year's flying (at least we were safe - not the biggest tragedy). Inflight review - flight attendants friendly & helpful when I indicted I had paid for vegetarian meal. the flight from Dulles to Addis was packed with bunch of folks not listening to instructions, babies crying and people leaving luggage in the aisles. Food - was happy to get my vegetarian (warm) tray (was likely pasta - rice), nothing too spectacular (honestly, Turkish Airlines is my favorite for airline food). Have decided to consider other airlines for my next trip to Mama Africa. Again, the staff gets a higher rating, but EA corporate really needs to up their game insofar as that phone support.",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

After arriving in Addis, I am told I may not board the plane to London as my COVID test has expired. The rule is that the test must be within 72 hours from departure. My test was valid and I was incorrectly stopped from boarding my plane. The airline then took 3 hours to help us book a hotel and pay for a visa. We were issued hotel vouchers and when arriving at the shuttle, the driver tells us that the vouchers are invalid and that the airline has not paid for our accommodation, even though I have paid the airline. We have no way of contacting the staff inside. After another 2 hours, a lady comes outside and changes our vouchers for the panorama hotel. When arriving at the Panorama hotel, the receptionist will not give me a room because I have no boarding pass. The reason I have no boarding pass is because your printing machine wasn’t working.

Anyways, when we went and submit the boarding pass, when i reached his colleague who was him at the time he approached got scared and i confirmed to her she was only barking at him and what happened to my surprise the guy had left the boarding with lots of people waiting in line to the plane before i arrive and which started the whole nightmare of the flight. When i reached the plane, the flight attendant when they saw my puppy made a big reaction “oh my god, that’s a dog” and the guy was standing in the middle, I didn’t bother i just asked where’s the seat direction and went ahead, never experienced such a reaction people overall had been approaching me all the time how cute ur puppy is, is it a she or a he, petting the puppy. Anyways, this experience didn’t end up here, while we’re flying to our destination, the cabin crew females, not all of them thank god, each time passing by one will stop and ask why my dog mouth isn’t shut, this happened 4 times already in a flight of 2 Hours!!!! In the end, i have responded “ I seriously don’t understand why everyone in this flight is picking on my dog and make it seem like a monster, why should i shut the mouth of my baby huh? You guys have been trying to create a new rule to not let my dog inside the flight and stating this is new law applicable from today like wow seriously who are you trying to fool, then how come i have paid the Ticket for my puppy before my 1st flight departure, the puppy is sitting in the pet carrier not making sound or anything, she’s just sitting peacefully so why the hell everyone on this flight is bullying us and treating her if she’s a monster, this is really the worst flight i have ever taken in my life and i have ended up crying in the plane like this is enough and i have made a decision that after all this years and due to the fact how we had been treated, i will stop being a loyal customer of Ethiopian Airlines And i will never book with them ever Again, the last one had apologised on behalf of the whole team and confirmed to me i am allowed to fly with my dog in cabin, i informed yes i am aware of my rights and it’s not you who need to apologise on behalf of the rest of them team, they are the one who should be apologising and in terms of rules i have been checking the pet policy of course so i know the rules and for that reason i will submit an official complaint on these people for creating fake law to not allow me to fly with my puppy and for the bullying that had occurred along the flight” I used to tell my friends about my experiences with this airlines and defending them, how much animal friendly they are but not anymore literally for me this airlines became the worst, and i will never going to recommend this airline for travelling with pets!

Mar,2021.0,3 out of 10 experience,Dubai,Harare International Economy,"Recently went on a last minute trip from Dubai to Harare with this airline. I am so very disappointed in the service given to their customers. Upon my departure from Dubai I checked in a day before my flight to help ease the check in process at the airport. I had the necessary documents ready. When I reached the airport it was total CHAOS at check in. It felt like I was at a market place. I had asked the one attendee there if there was a line for online check in as I didn’t want to wait in line with so many people. There was no social distancing AT ALL!!! Complete chaos!! It took nearly 2 hours for me to stand in line and check in. Never in the history of my travels have I ever experienced this! Time for boarding the plan, the plan was completely booked. No space to even breathe. I booked a premium seat in economy to have a little extra space. There were 2 women that sat in the seats next to me that were not assigned to those seats. Their bulky luggage at the feet flights attendants not really paying any attention at all.. breakfast was horrible. Had the option to choose between pancakes and eggs. Since I don’t eat eggs I vouched for the pancakes. Little did I know it was a CAKE!!!! With berry jam. Never touched it at all. When we got to the airport in Ethiopia there were exposed wires and construction going on. Not very safe for families traveling with kids.. The flight from Addis to Harare was ok. Flight from Harare to Addis was fine. Less people. But when we got to the airport in Addis once again I felt so unsafe. So many people walking around without their masks. Toilets smelling like something died in there. So much over crowding!! I don’t understand. We are living in this pandemic and have witnessed daily on the news the thousands of people that are dying from this virus. Why aren’t there guards to ensure that everyone in the airport is wearing their masks!!! On the flight there were about 4 to 5 men walking around the plane without any masks on and I saw the attendants casually walking passed them without saying anything. The flights attendants are also not really in to their jobs as they look so tired or fed up with everything. Being a frequent flyer with emirates I was not able to book my flight with them and had to opt for Ethiopian airlines. Please take this as constructive feedback to protect your staff and those of the passengers. This is a serious issue that really needs to addressed. This is a lovely airline and has so much potential but the negligence of the staff is not acceptable to me.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Mar,2021.0,Poor customer service at Bole International airport,Niamey,Seoul International Economy,"The customer service of the Ethiopian airline at the Bole International airport is very poor, especially the Interline office department. While on a flight to Korea, I was stopped in Addis because apparently the Alien card I normally used for traveling could not be used since I had been outside of Korea for over a year. But the problem is that the Ethiopian airline officer in my initial departure place had said that the problem I had (getting a boarding pass from Addis to Seoul) would be fixed once in Addis, because they had confirmed with the Ethiopian airline in Bole International airport , saying it was a system error. But arriving there, I was treated like a criminal, my passport was also confiscated and I got it back home as I was deported. But the treatment was very bad; there was also another pregnant lady who had a certain issue, and was mistreated. Despite her being in agony, tired and the time being 2 am, they did not care to give her any care. Later they said she would have a flight back to her home her her in 3 days time (Friday 12 March, the day was Wednesday 10th March). Right now, she is probably still at the airport. And she has not received any care. They only said they would give her some meal coupons for meals at the airport. But come on! This is someone who is pregnant, the health of two people are concerned! Stop treating people like animals !! A generous Zimbabwean man tried to help her by giving her his her room her her in the platinum lounge. But the staff refused. And when that man asked the staff ""do you have a wife?""the other guy had the guts to say ""she is not the only pregnant woman travelling"". I was shocked by this ""customer service!",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

This is were the problem is. Ethiopian Airways need to monitor their hotel partners. At the two hotels I transited in, the food was the worst I have ever eaten. undercooked and unseasoned. In one hotel (Caravan) all guests almost revolted!

Apr,2021.0,Played me for a fool this April,Johannesburg,Dubai International Economy,"I have always loved the airline and as it was efficient and cost effective. However last year I experienced great difficulty with the airline but wrote it off as a covid thing. I bought a return ticket from DXB to SA. I had to move my date sooner as the airport was closing. The airline wanted to charge me as a result knowing they won’t be able to operate flights on my initial date of departure. I eventually manage to change the book and had to leave that same day. I upgraded to business class and the service was non existent, Iv had way better experiences in economy. I then couldn’t leave South Africa due to the lockdown and I was told I could apply for a refund or change the date. I lost my job and had no reason to return to Dubai so I applied for the refund. After numerous emails back and forth I was told it’s not possible. This year I emailed them asking if I could rebook and they said yes however there is a ban on South Africa. I waited and watched news updates and was later informed by an online chat agent I could go ahead and book. I booked for today thinking the airline had new information and maybe the ban was lifted. I mean why else would I be advised to go ahead and book. They then wanted to charge me 75USD additionally. After explaining their own terms and conditions to them the booking was finally made. I then saw the ban was extended and tried to change the booking l, now they introduced more fees. My flight is leaving now and here I am sitting writing this review because I’m unable to cancel it, nor rebook it. I being charged a no show fee and rebooking fee of 125USD approximately. I have emailed so many different departments with no replies or responses. The reservations time reply, however it’s like I’m emailing robots with only limited responses so all they do is copy and paste information. I don’t mind the fees however I’m forced to believe that they do not care about their clients only about making money for the airline. I was wrongly advised and when I asked I was either ignored or given dilutive Information. The airline says they treat their passengers like gods but it’s not true they treat you like a fool!

I called the Ethiopian Airlines call-center number, Facebook, and finally reached someone directly from their webpage. This CSA advised me to purchase another ticket - a one-way from London. He explained that once the second purchase was in the system, Ethiopian Airlines would then combine both reservations and issue me a refund. On June 30, 2021, I called back to inquire about the price adjustment/refund as the agent had indicated as well as make sure my return was still valid. It took several calls. Each agent said the information I was originally given was wrong and he should have simply changed my departure city. However, a supervisor would have to review the audiotapes of our conversation before issuing the refund. I kept calling and being told to wait until the tapes were reviewed. I even reached out to Ethiopian Airlines via Twitter. On my return from my trip, I attempted to reach out to Ethiopian Airlines several times to no avail. I tried to dispute the charges with my credit card but ET told them I had used both tickets and the credit card company declined to make any further investigations. On August 23/24, I reached out to ET via a reservation email I found online as well as some manager emails I found online. On August 25, one of the managers responded, adding the US customer service team and asking that they provide assistance. The response I finally received from customer service on 07 September states that both tickets are on used status. On November 08, 2021, after sending several messages to ET, someone reached out asking for the date I made the phone call. After requesting feedback several times, I received a response on January 07, 2022, 6 months after my initial call, saying they were unable to confirm the phone call I placed and the matter was considered closed. I paid $636.90 for the initial round trip and $737.41 for the one-way. This purchase was not made lightly but I was going to attend a funeral and didn't want to miss it.

Whilst were relieved that the bag finally turned up 3weeks later with our continued pressing, it took a great toll on us. When we tried to claim the $75 incidental payment mentioned on their website as part of their commitment to customers in such distress, thei response was to say ""you checked in 2 bags and since we delivered 1, Ethiopian airlines won't pay anything"". This is despite our desperate pleas for the bag to be located as it had all of the clothes of one of our children. The locked bag was opened in Addis and would've been seen to evidently contain the clothes as listed. So in the 3weeks that the bag was missing, we were forced to spend money on our child's clothes, on following up through calls, emails and visiting their offices, and eventually more spent on going to the m Airport to pick up the bag and absolutely no token of compensation for the costs, inconveniences, stress and lost sleep incurred at their expense.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Clear day, unlimited vis. Pilot shot a missed approach. Pilot got it right the second time. Upon landing the pilot announced the missed approach was not his fault, but a power outage at Harare Airport (no back up power present). They Harare Airport got the power back and he landed the aircraft the second time. The pilot then announced, once we'd landed, that we would be delayed further because power went out again and all on-boarding needed to be done by hand (one hour delay). The pilot then announced a further delay, as an airliner landing on our departure runway came in hard, blowing multiple tires (There were no recovery vehicles at airport and it was Saturday afternoon). When we eventually made it into the air, pilot announced that people would be on the ground in Addis to expedite our now late/missed connections. Guess what didn't happen?

This was a horrible flight. 1) A flight attendant was serving water in the cabin (nice since they confiscated all water bottles before boarding). I was seated in the back of a cabin. She ran out of water and never came back. Who cares? 2) The food and beverage service was absolutely the slowest I've ever seen in my life (out of about 100 trans-Atlantic flights). You would have had to work hard to go any slower. There were two flight attendants serving - and two standing around doing absolutely nothing. I have never see a lazier group of flight attendants in my life. 3) The food was worse than bad - inedible. The beef was nothing but grizzle and fat - I wouldn't serve this to my dog. No plan or organization for service - none. Terrible flight. Among the worst flights I've been on. The cabin crew was lazy beyond words.

It relates to ticket sales conditions. I have given a 4/5 rating for all services I am not justified to answer because I did not fly. I was booked to depart from Dar-es-Salaam at 4:45pm on 2nd Aug 2021, and then connect in Addis Ababa the following day 3rd August for the flight to Victoria Falls. Ethiopian then emailed me to say that my flight would now depart on 4th August - 2 days later - apologizing for any inconvenience caused, but not offering me an option to accept or cancel. I decided to buy another ticket on a different airline and ask for a refund. When I asked for a refund they stated that their terms state that any cancellation will be charged $200. This surprised me because in essence I had not cancelled a flight that I had booked. They had given me a different service - 2 days later, and I had refused that change. SO I strongly advise anyone to buy their ticket with Ethiopian LAST MINUTE, when they know the flight will happen, rather than risk losing $200 for the privilege of booking early. Covid requirements have made planning flights extremely difficult, and this is made changes expensive when airlines change flight times /days and cannot refund you, even though they cannot deliver as booked.

I explained my reasons why I couldn't travel on the agreed date and that I wanted to reschedule to a later date and how much it would cost me. that's when the con game started, she advised me to just open the ticket and I can book it any time I am ready to travel, I asked her will there be any charges she said no we don't charge any charges for opening tickets she magically forgot to tell me when your re-booking you may be required to add some cash depending on the current rates. which I would be okay with if I was informed. came the day of re-booking that's when the con game was at play. I called the Ethiopian airlines office in Nairobi told them I want to re-book. the same lady picked the phoned I explained myself to her the tone changed now I was officially a bait, she said currently we are busy let me see if I can find you a seat as we are fully booked for the next two days I pleaded with her not knowing I was digging my own grave. she put me on hold for like ten minutes came back to me saying I have to pay 358 dollars if I wanted a seat on the next available flight. remember I paid 544.51 dollars for the return flight .but now I am being told to pay 358 dollars additional fee. at this time she knew I was desperate to get back to work I had to play to the con game. so basically I paid for my return flight which I just wanted to be rescheduled the saddest part is that the day of the flight we flew with some empty seats from NAIRO-ADDIS /ADDID -DXB. i mean I understand the re-booking fee but three-quarters of the initial amount for a one route flight, but i have learned my lesson I used to hold Ethiopian Airlines in high regard but sadly I had to swallow the bitter pill..thank you.",2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

And horrible airport at Addis,Dar es Salaam,London International Economy,A horrible experience with the airline they do not allow you to book meals online when I call reservations they had no idea how to do it. They give me an answer to say call 24 hours before departure while the rules on the website says you must book it 72 hours in advance. They were very in unhelpful when I asked them about Covid travel requirements on their airline as UK does not require any testing anymore reservations said our website is not been updated so you need to get testing done regardless of what the rules for the country are. They don’t know when they’ll update the website until they update the website you have to follow their rules rather than the countries rules. I called again and they told me I don’t need testing. Luckily I did the test anyway and at the airport half the people will let go without any tests and a half the people were being harassed by the airline asking them for tests and none of the staff seem to know the rules. Watch out at Addis airport they try and continue cup of coffee or tea is US$5 the most expensive I’ve ever seen anywhere in the world. I tried to buy four bars of chocolate and was told US$9 but the lady at the counter kid in US$20 on the card machine in local currency is there no tourists do not check. When I confronted them as I had a message on my phone with the amount they tried to make up an excuse that all of a sudden $9 was adding up US$20 on a calculator that is US$5 for one bar of snickers After a fight I got a refund of my money and bought it with cash one door from that store for US$1 so be careful they will try con you . Also they do not update the Information on the screen to show if your flights boarding or not. We were waiting for boarding time to show up on the screen when we turned up to the gate the flighted already boarded and the staff said nobody ever update the screens on the airport,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

No social distancing. Boarding time was met with similar chaos - even with boarding zones clearly stipulated it was pushing and shoving to get to the front. On board the chaos continued as the flight was apparently ""overbooked"" and people were moved from one seat to another. On-board staff was very friendly and tried their best but by then most people were fed-up. Economy seats are extremely uncomfortable and having flown with various airlines before this is probably poorest seat quality we have experienced. In our group of 4 we had one traveler that found entertainment screen out of order on the outbound flight and one on the inbound flight. Transit in Addis Ababa seemed better organised but the airport is a rip-off with a coffee (in a take-away cup) at 5USD and a Beer between 6USD and 10USD. Also no social distancing when boarding. Planes are not cleaned or sanitised in change overs and both flights from and to Addis Ababa to Zanzibar we had to clean and spray ourselves. Whilst the tickets was the cheapest, I would not recommend the airline and if possible not use them again. You can put in bid for upgrade to business class that seems a bit cheaper (if successful) than buying Business Class outright but I am not sure it will make it better as the expectations against price is then much higher and many of the problems were not flying class related.

Jan,2022.0,My experience was not a pleasant one to say the least,Washington DC,Ethiopia,"I used the airline App to purchase a ticket one month before my travels from the United States to Ethiopia and was able to reserve a specific seat at the same time. I reserved seat 50L because of my high blood pressure condition. I needed to be seated away from any active passengers to ensure I would be able to have enough sleep which was necessary due to my medical condition. On the day of my travel to Ethiopia I went to check in and discovered my seat was changed from 50L to 13B which was next to children and was in the middle. I spoke with your ticketing agent at the airport who was not willing to assist me. I then spoke to a Manager who told me they are not selling seats but are selling tickets and that seat reservations made in advance didn’t really matter. I was almost crying because the airline staff were very rude and not willing to assist me at all. I feel they were calling me a liar telling me that I had not reserved seat 50L. Another passenger who overheard my conversation with your Manager gave me her seat which helped with my situation. Once I arrived in Ethiopia I went to the Addis Ababa office Which is the one in Addis Ababa to speak with someone concerning the negative experience I had with my seat reservation. Your staff member took my statement and I was told by her that I would receive an email containing the report your staff member had written. As of today, I have not received an email. I then asked her for assistance with my seat reservation for my return flight. She confirmed seat 50L was reserved for me and apologized for the negative experience I had on my flight to Ethiopia. Three days prior to my return flight back to the United States, I checked to confirm once again that I was seated in seat 50L. I then discovered that my seat reservation had been changed to seat 27B. I was really upset and when I contacted your airline I was told my seat had changed due to a change in the aircraft for the return flight. I asked why your airline does not send out an email when they change a passengers seat reservation, the agent on the phone for your airline told me that the best seat is always given to a Crew member. I was completely was shocked to hear that. I went to the Ethiopian Airlines office again to fix my seat reservation to what your agent had reserved for me. I spent three days of my vacation going from one office to another office to resolve my seat reservation problem as your App was giving me a system error. My negative experience with Ethiopia Airlines makes it less likely that I will use your airline for my travels to Ethiopia. I feel your management team needs additional training in customer service and your reservation system needs to be looked at so that your customers are alerted via email when their seat reservation has been changed. My experience with Ethiopia Airlines was not a pleasant one to say the least.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

The hostesses said there was nothing they could do, although they could have moved those persons to other empty seats or even upgrade me and simply said I should write to customer service.

Jan,2022.0,giving priority to its employees over passengers,London,Addis Ababa,"Having flown on Ethiopian Airlines number of times before I knew what to expect. It was a pleasant surprise to discover that the A350 had its latest business seats which were fairly standard although hiding the remote control in a cupboard did not seem to make much sense. As I arrived, despite only half the seats being occupied at that point, all of the overhead bins occupied and many of them were larger than the size the airline allows. I asked one of the cabin crew what was happening and she conceded – very apologetically – that all of the bags belonged to crew members. I managed to squeeze my bag next to an oversized pilots’ case. There seem to be at least five pilots occupying seats largely at the front of the business cabin which, of course, meant that they were served food and drink first. If Ethiopian Airlines wants to achieve reputation for being the best airline in Africa then it should try to emulate best practice and seemingly giving priority to its employees over passengers who had paid a significant amount of money to fly business class is not the best way of doing this. The cabin crew seemed embarrassed but clearly did not feel able to challenge their pilots. Other than this irritation the flight was smooth, the service efficient, the seats comfortable and both getting on and off the aircraft went smoothly.",5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,AirlineQuality

In particular, I remain grateful to Mr. Alemu Dubiesa Hieye, the super-manager in Asmara, for his kindness and co-operation in helping me get in the plane, literally, just a few minutes before the plane took-off to Addis. I must say that I arrived in the airport in Asmara so late as it was difficult for me to get the corona form completed there. Mr. Alemu is definitely my super-hero for 2022 because he made it possible for me to travel to London happily. The staff and crews go all the way to help and please their passengers. Ethiopian became best airlines twice recently - that is for 2020 and 2021. I think their kindness and co-operation might have been one of the many reasons which helped it to win the hearts of its passengers. Well done!

If there was no existing booking, why again do we have to pay for the ""no show fee""? We felt like the Airline is constantly trying to rip us off by asking for 1) expensive changing fee, THEN 2) no show fee (why would we pay for no show when we clearly would not show up hence we paid to change the flight?), 3) constant threatening by saying ""prices"" are subject to change any minute in the customer support email, asking for our credit card details!

This is my first time taking Ethiopian Airlines and it will be my last.

I was not asked if that was OK. I was moved to another seat and a few minutes later the passenger of that seat arrived and I had to be moved yet again. The discrimination inflight was glaring with Ethiopian nationals being attended to courteously. I paid $5k+ for this flight and this will be my last time.

The feel of the cabin is inferior to Emirates or Qatar. One feels this in the quality of the Duvet, slippers, and the vanity bag, as well as the headphones. The WORST experience is the POOR check-in PROCESS. One of the main reasons for paying for Business Class tickets is not having to cue. The check-in was slow for both check-in on departure and return. Business-class passengers should be prioritsed. In addition, there should be a BAG drop of cue - what's the point of checking in online if you still have to stand with everyone and wait, simply to drop off your bag?

The toilet is not kept clean and in a sorrowful state.

The check in staff demanded if we had done the RT-PCR Test & filled Air Suvidha Form as required by Indian Govt. As we had not, they refused to check in our Baggage. We were unaware of this procedure as Online Check-In was done a day earlier via Ethiopian Airlines website. No Reports were asked during the Online Check In Procedure. Also we could have taken the express RT-PCR Test in Cape Town Airport so that we could catch the flight back which was not known by us. The Ethiopian Airlines staff was Rude & Curt and refused to tell us anything. Till the Flight for Addis Ababa took off, they did not listen to a word we said & then cancelled our Return Flight with the reason : No Show (Even though we were standing right opposite the Check In counter). As per Airline Rules, they needed to rebook 4 of us on the next available flight to Addis Ababa & onward to Mumbai. (Monday, 2nd May.,2022.) We tried contacting Ryan Rocha, Sales Manager Passenger, Ethiopian Airlines, 104 Windfall, Sahar Plaza Complex , Andheri Kurla Road,Andheri East, Mumbai 400059 Tel: +91-22-28395468. But there was no response or the phone no. did not exist. We visited South Africa for a Rotary Friendship Exchange program & not a Tourist visit & the SA Visa was expiring in 3 days. We went to the Medical centre @Cape Town Airport for RT-PCR Tests & paid ZAR 2000 for 4Pax. The reports were sent to our email within 24 hours. We had to book a hotel & pay USD 250+ for 2 days stay. Uploaded the RT-PCR reports on Air Suvidha Website of Indian Govt on 1st May,2022. Imagine our surprise when we reached the Airport at 10.30 am on 2nd May, 2022. The check-in Staff asked us to purchase our Return Flight tickets again for ZAR 12,440 (About USD 840) which we had no choice but do as demanded. This is the worst experience faced by me in my 50 years flying on different Airlines all over the world. I will be posting this in Rotary Club magazine also. If they value Rotary International business in the future, they should refund the amount extorted from our group for Return flights to MUMBAI (CPT-ADD-BOM). It was their duty to have informed us about the RT-PCR Report in advance before confirming the online Check In.

Check-in system malfunction and some passengers including myself despite having boarding passes and able to check-in not able to board due to them not being able to check bags on the plane manually due to security procedures. Understandable. 21:00 in the evening on a Friday night. Ground staff contingency plan is to tell everyone who is trying to get home to go home in a foreign County. No offer for hotel accommodation or guidance in the matter. Staff main focus was getting themselves home as gate was closed. This company has tested my resolve now and it will not go unchallenged. The mere fact that this is the level of service afforded customers when it comes to these incidents is proof that Ethiopian Airlines has ever been challenged previously by their customers.

In Addis Ababa, I presented my boarding pass and was told there is a seat change. I thought they were upgrading my seat due to the roach incident and the delay in Nairobi. Nope! They rather downgraded me and gave my seat to another passenger. When I protested I was threatened by a very unprofessional, rude and disrespectful agent at the counter. They threatened to unload my luggage from the plane if I do not take the downgraded seat assigned to me. Bottom line, Ethiopian Airlines in the absolute worst airline.

Jun,2022.0,Worst Experience,Entebbe,Nosy Be Africa Economy,"Was travelling from Entebbe to Nosy Be Madagascar on 7th Jun'22 with my 18 colleagues for a corporate team building event. Our luggage was left behind in Addis during transit despite assurance by Airline staff that the luggage was on board. All my clothes, personal effects and medication was in my luggage!! How do you expect someone who has to take medication twice daily to stay for 5 Days without crucial medication? Does the Airline take Responsibility??...What if something happens to someone's health due to the Airline's negligence and carelessness?? Finally when I got my luggage in Addis on 11th Jun on the way back to Entebbe, ...the bag was very dirty and oily ..one of my colleagues bag was damaged and the casing torn!! This was the Worst and Most Traumatising experience for me in My travelling history!! The worst and annoying part is that the Airline Staff were least bothered and un-appologetic about our experience!!

Jun,2022.0,Total Disaster!,Entebbe,Nosy Be Africa Economy,"We are a team of 19 people who travelled from Entebbe to Andilana Beach Resort, Nosy Be, Madagascar, for corporate team-building activities. Why do we register this experience as a total disaster? 1. The economy class was very hot, near suffocation, and the seats were broken (23C). Wed complained to the captain, but he rudely ignored! 2. There was a delay in landing in Addis Ababa due to fog, which is understandable. HOWEVER, while boarding the connecting flight to Nosy Be, we asked the Airline Boarding Staff to first confirm the status of the check-in luggage of all 19 of us to ensure that it had been loaded on our flight. The Boarding Staff came with his senior manager and confirmed that all the luggage for the 19 people had been loaded on our transfer flight from Addis Ababa to Nosy Be. 3. We happily landed in Nosy Be on Tuesday, 7th June 2022, BUT shockingly, we were reluctantly told that all our check-in luggage for all 19 people was missing! The Airline Manager in Nosy Be seemed aware of this, and the whole team started avoiding us. We were further shocked to learn that there was no flight to bring our luggage till our departure on Saturday, 11th June 2022! Our team members almost collapsed because this trip had been planned for two years. We were stranded on an island, with a language barrier, no clothes, no reserve money and the worst part was that all our team building materials were in the luggage! 4. Finally, the Airline Manager offered each person USD 75 only for four days as compensation! But in Andilana Beach Resort, only one shirt costs USD 85! He was also kind enough to offer each of us a Star Alliance Overnight Kit. SHOCKINGLY, all the products in the Star Alliance Overnight Kit are long expired!! How dare an international airline give expired products to their customers? Imagine staying in a 4-Star hotel, with no changing clothes, no sandals, no shaving kit, no cosmetics and no medicines (4 of us are diabetic)! This is disastrous! We had to forego the purpose of the trip, which was team building. Don't you think we deserve compensation for the whole trip other than a simple sorry email? Note: After a two-hour fracas in Addis, only 17 people managed to get luggage upon returning to Entebbe, One person got his luggage after one week, and another is still missing!

Jun,2022.0,horrible all around experience,Ndola,Nuremberg International Economy,"We booked a roundtrip through Ethiopian's webpage that included a stretch on each leg with Lufthansa. Problem 1) It was not possible to check in online for the Lufthansa flight - neither via Lufthansa (""need to check in with Ethiopian"") nor with Ethiopian (no reason or option even given) Problem 2) So we checked in at the Lufthansa counter in Nuremberg, since that was the first stretch. There, we were told that the cooperation between Ethiopian and Lufthansa was not very good as the software systems weren't compatible. So we needed to go to the Ethiopian counter at the next airport (Frankfurt) and present our luggage tags in order for the suitcases to be transferred into Ethiopian's system. Problem 3) After waiting in line for 45 minutes at the Ethiopian counter upon arriving in Frankfurt, we were told that the luggage indeed was not yet in Ethiopian's system. At the same time, we were given new boarding passes for the next flight (without asking for them, because I had already checked in online) to Addis and told that boarding passes for the last flight to Ndola would need to be printed out in Addis. Problem 4) When the agent printed out the boarding passes, she changed the seat for my toddler child to about 20 rows away from the rest of us. Of course I hadn't noticed right away, because I didn't expect her to change the seats we had selected and checked in for at home. So I had to stand in line another 30 minutes to get that fixed (could only be partly fixed, however). Problem 5) The remainder of the trip then went surprisingly smooth, apart from Addis being a completely chaotic airport. But that was the smallest issue. Bigger issue was communication with Ethiopian. Since our layover in Frankfurt on the return trip was to be relatively short, I wrote Ethiopian and asked whether it was possible to get boarding passes for the Frankfurt -> Nuremberg stretch with Lufthansa at the Ethiopian counter upon our departure in Ndola. That was confirmed in writing. Then we received an email from Ethiopian - after we had checked in less than 48 hours before departure (not for the Lufthansa flight, of course, as that wasn't possible) - that our flight time had changed. However, not only our flight time had changed, also the departure airport was changed from Ndola to Lusaka. A distance of about 400km. Problem 6) Eventually, we were contacted by the local Ethiopian office (the global office had told us that we needed to make our own way to Lusaka). They had booked a flight with a different airline to Lusaka, extending our trip by more than 3.5 hours and adding another stop. Also, we had to collect and check-in our luggage in Lusaka. Problem 7) As expected, it was not possible to get boarding passes for the Lufthansa flight at the Ethiopian counter. We were told by the agent that she could not access Lufthansa's system. Problem 8) I had premium seat reservations for the cancelled flight. It had been confirmed in writing that we would get the same seats on the replacement flights. However, upon check-in, we were told that those seats were not available and were given different seats. As a tall guy, I really like some extra leg room. Problem 9) Of course, Ethiopian stopped responding to emails once I pointed out that literally all information they gave me was wrong. Overall, it was a horrible experience. We managed to catch the connection in Frankfurt after running through Terminal 1 and getting boarding passes printed at the Lufthansa counter. What annoyed me most, however, was the really poor (and now non-existent) communication on Ethiopian's part. Mistakes and problems can always arise, but with good and correct communication everything's just half as bad. But with Ethiopian, it was a complete mess and the horrible communication actually makes issues even worse, because you can't trust on Ethiopian to provide proper solutions.",3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,TripAdvisor

This means if they lose your bag(s) no matter how much you spent on clothing they can offer you what they please which I think is unfair. Please be aware when flying Ethiopian Airlines.

I have never experienced this with any other airline but this happened on 3 out of the 4 flights. I will never ever fly with these again.

I used this airlines for the first time and got this unfortunate situation. I would never ever use this airline or recommend for any one I know. Though I paid $2,215 for two ways at the beginning, my flight was canceled due to covid19. I informed the Ethiopian Airlines in my country, but they would not care or take responsibility of people whose airticket was canceled due to the pandemic, COVID19. They told me to pay $4,000 with business class as there was no seat with economic class. I had no option. I had to pay $4,000 additional fees to come back to USA. Total $6,215, only for 1 person, very sad and annoying. HOW CAN YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE DURING THE PANDEMIC? The Turkish or Dubai Airlines reserve seats for their clients who get affected by COVID19. However, the Ethiopian Airlines do not care of their clients who get affected with Covid19.

We received 2/4 suitcases, and 1 that was not ours. We asked the delivery guy to return it as it was not ours but they marked that we have received all 4 of our suitcases. Thank God I took pictures to show the mismatch and error, but Ethiopian Airlines still does not want to take responsibility. It has been 1 month and a half going back and forth - whenever the process is going ahead, they cancel, do not communicate and close cases while you think some progress is being made. The fact that 3 companies were involved, it has been a nightmare and my suitcase is still not delivered, located or found. But ETH refuses to help, support and only tell me to deal with the courier, which in fact has nothing to do with me. I pray no one has to go through this stress!

Left Hong Kong and arrived in Bangkok as per schedule. All is well, except there is a need that the crew is better versed on the required immigration procedures at the port of arrival as well as what is required to show to the authority as per COVID rules. Nobody had a clue and hence I was handed over a document wherein I had to state I am COVID positive (which is not the case) and for the rest, I drew a full blank from all crew members.

Jul,2022.0,Unscheduled flight diversion without notice for their convenience,Kilimanjaro National Park,Washington DC International Business Class,"I've never had this happen before in my over 1M miles flown. We booked round trip tickets to and from Tanzania from Washington Dulles. We found the least connections and fastest option is Ethiopian Airlines unless you want to add an additional 5-6 hours onto your flight via Istanbul to use Turkish Airlines (which I prefer). Flight cost was reasonable but not cheap as we chose business class/Cloud Nine. Both directions we booked a very comfortable layover in Addis Ababa so that I could walk the distance between flights comfortably. I have arthritis and it's very hard for me to walk fast after sitting for long periods, so I book accordingly. On our return flight, we boarded in Kilimanjaro, flight looked to be on time, and we had two hours in Addis Ababa. As soon as the last passenger boarded, and flight crew prepared for take-off the pilot made an announcement that they are going to add a stop in Dar es Salaam to pick up some passengers. What??? This added an additional hour and 30 minutes to our flight. What was worse if that when we picked up those passengers in Dar one didn't get on but checked luggage. Another 30 minutes counting passengers and getting his baggage off the flight. We now arrived in Addis Ababa AFTER boarding began for our long-haul flight to IAD. We were escorted off the plane to a bus, bus to lower-level processing area for international travelers, went through passport control (line - wait) then up through to terminal to 'run', as best I could, to our next flight which fortunately was still boarding past the time they normally close the doors. Once on board, plane doors shut, pilot announces a delay due to baggage handling. Would have loved those extra minutes which turned into an hour delay! Half the plane coming to Addis Ababa was making long haul international connections. When we ran past the ORD flight, we noticed that those who were behind us in passport queue likely didn't make it. In addition to this chaos I've never experienced, the flight crew couldn't be less concerned about the passengers' connections concerns and offered little to no help. In fact, towards the end of the flight I heard some curt responses coming from the attendants to reasonable questions from others regarding their connections. The food was terrible, the plain, on all four legs, were filthy. I would definitely avoid Ethiopian at all costs, both financial and time related in the future.",2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

The meat looked like cat food and on one flight the side to a pasta dish (the pasta was falling apart) was just more cold pasta. The service onboard was incredible slow and they gave very little info. We had a stopover in Sweden for around 2 hours early in the morning and they closed the toilets to prevent people from getting up from their seats to count the passengers- which I guess is ok enough, but there was no information about the closed toilets or the counting so the passengers got up to wait in line to use the toilets, and were then told to sit back down AND then the staff had to start counting over again and again. Just very chaotic and frustrating. They don’t answer the phone if you try to call them either and we met a girl who had called customer service for 20 days to get help to find a bag the airline lost..",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

My flight was delayed 7 hr at the start of my itinerary. I was never updated on the new departure time. I kept calling the global center (7x) and they would not verify the new departure time! My flight eventually left at 4am instead of 9pm but I missed all my travel connections and the start of my safari vacation. All my vacation plans had to be changed at last minute and this was extremely stressful and worrisome. Then Ethiopian airlines lost my luggage for 7 days. No one from the airlines would help me. They kept saying they had no idea where the bag was even though I knew it was in Addis! The Ethiopian website is not helpful as it is not ever updated! No one contacted me so I had to spend my safari time following up. Finally after 5 days the airline said they would compensate me $100 for the lost bag (pitiful compensation)…but no one at Ethiopian Global office nor in DC would assist me. I am not able to get the compensation! The airlines said they can not help me and I needed to speak with their offices in South Africa! This has been a nightmare experience ! Especially on a business class ticket. For my safari, I was without clothes for half the vacation. Now I Can not get compensation. Everyone I speak to at Ethiopian airlines is extremely rude. No one will let me speak to a manager, or assist me or say they are sorry. On my way home, I had to fight to sit in the Ethiopian lounge. They said I could not sit in the lounge for more than 3 hr and my layover was longer. When I checked on my luggage in Johannesburg , they told the lounge staff I did not have any bags checked in although I had bag tags to prove I had checked luggage - my bag was missing again. I had not yet left Johannesburg. Ethiopian airlines ruined my very expensive vacation and still won’t let me speak to any management about this trip!

Felt like you were eating gelatine. We also had a delay to the flight from Addis ABBA to Johannesburg which resulted in us missing an internal flight and no one assumes responsibility for the consequences. I ended up hiring a vehicle at Johannesburg Airport to Durban as there were no other available flights with anyone else for two days. The end of the journey resulted in a lost bag and it is now 6 days later and I do not have my bag. Many calls and complaints later and I have nothing. I will never use Ethipian Airlines ever again.

Jul,2022.0,Shocking treatment by cabin crew and on ground manager!,Dubai,Addis Ababa International Economy,"Traumatic experience upon flight ET613 to Addis Ababa which was due to depart DXB at 5.40am 11/07/22. Signs of an issue began to show when at 5.20am boarding was just beginning. By 6.15am, we were still on ground and people had begun complaining about the temperature as there was no AC, we were told it will work after takeoff. Passengers waited, security checks were made but still no take off, although the plane had left the gate. There was a brief announcement from the pilot stating that they were technical issues and that people should remain seated, however as more people complained about the now unbearable heat, cabin crew vanished and left us to fend for ourselves. Passengers began to panic, and started frantically removing luggage from the overhead lockers. To sum it up, this was an extremely dangerous situation and the poor management of your staff only added to the panic. It wasn't until several passengers, myself included made calls to the emergency services that the police arrived and we were finally let off the plane. By this point it was just after 7am and some passengers even required medical assistance! We waited a short while for buses to arrive and then sat on the buses for a further 20 minutes without moving! Being in another enclosed space was not ideal after what we had just been through. Once back in departures, Ethiopian Airlines representatives came over and informed the largely agitated crowd to go to a new gate and board the plane. He, however failed to inform us that it was in fact the same aircraft we had just disembarked! If cabin crew had at least tried to reassure us that the issue was being dealt with, given updates and at least handed out water; then perhaps the situation would have been a little more bearable but to abandon a plane full of people who thought they 'were going to die' (some passengers were actually shouting this) is completely unacceptable. After just having been through this traumatic experience, myself and a few other passengers were not willing to board the same aircraft and we spoke to Mr Teshome Regassa- operations manager to ask for our luggage. He then proceeded to tell me that I was delaying the plane by doing this and that it was just a small technical issue. This was extremely disrespectful as he was not the one who had just been stuck on a plane for nearly two hours with no AC, no assistance from staff, while passengers became angry and hysterical and babies screamed from the discomfort. I arrived at DXB at 3am and was at the gate well before the scheduled boarding time, so to be blamed for a delay which had nothing to do with me was absurd! I've sent several emails and called countless times since 11/07/22, yet no response! If using this airline avoid flight ET613, if you have a look at its flight history, you'll find many delays due to technical issues, yet these were supposedly fixed.",3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

The experience was more than pathetic and this carrier should not be awarded to be part of the STAR Alliance Group. The product is inferior and the service pathetic. Aircrafts: They have some newish Airbus 350-900 which have a ok configuration but they are very squashed and don't feel very comfortable. The older B777-200 is past its life and should be retired. The aircraft from ADD to FCO was a piece of garbage. In Business Class upon take-off about 50% of the seats did not recline. After manual override and intervention by the crew they got some more seats fixed but were left with a number of seats that would not recline. In the end you pay for Business class but end up on a Economy style seat with a crew that is totally out of its depth to deal with. Cleanliness: The aircraft are filthy and unclean already on boarding. During the flight the bathrooms are not kept clean by the crew. There is ample staff but they are disorganised. Procedures: The crew does not follow basic safety proctoll. During take-off and landing neither seatbelts nor hand-luggage is checked for its safety. On landing of one sector a glass flew thru the cabin that was not collected before. WIFI: Although promoted as USD 25 for 24 hours on multiple sectors one had to pay another USD 25 for the second flight. No refund received despite a request. Boarding: A total mess. Lounge in ADD: Crowded and not clean, Quality of food is poor and wine selection even poorer. Prio Bag: Business Class luggage is not handled with priority and delivered with the rest of the bags - often towards the end. One one sector the bag did not arrive at all.

It was not maintained well. The roof boards were loose. The bathroom was duck taped together. The sink section came out of its socket and was open up. The plane should be taken in for proper maintenance. The food is terrible and I’m one who enjoys plane food. The chicken was rubbery and bland. I recommend bringing your own food. The staff barely offer you something to drink and when the staff were told about the damage they did not attend to it. The equipment on the plane is old and some lucky passengers were given earphones and a blanket, we had to request these items. The second flight was somehow worse. The flight was overbooked. The food was even worse than the first flight, inedible except the bread and cheese. The staff kept the cabin lights on throughout the night so it is impossible to sleep. I requested three times for the cabin lights to be turned off during the dark and I was ignored even though this was possible on the first flight. The seating is uncomfortable and small. This flight ran out of drinkable water. The movies were outdated and it was an unpleasant and long flight. If you travel far I recommend Qatar Airways, it’s more worth the money you pay.

I feel robbed after luggage went missing with fairly new clothes and cosmetics as well as carefully curated items bought in Africa and gifts from my family at home which I haven’t been back to in many years. They only responded to my baggage claim 10 days after submitting, saying they would send my bag the following day but then ghosted me and have never acknowledged or compensated for the bag and contents. I’ve emailed almost every contact on their list and never heard back. None of their phone numbers work either. They are at best useless and my experience with them has caused so much anxiety.

Spoiled trip after waiting 3 years to travel home after Covid,Manchester,Harare International Economy,"I have never seen such poor treatment from an airline like l experienced with Ethiopian Airlines. They try to get as much money from customers as possible. Very unprofessional behavior from staff.. First they said our bags were overweight then we took staff out reweighed then went back and they then said the bag was too big then charged us £80. We proceed to the boarding gate then they said my wife was not traveling because apparently she had bleach in her bag which was already on the plane.They took off the bag and when she checked the bag in the hotel there was no bleach. We were forced to rebook her ticket with a different airline costing us £1200. The staff tried to charge me £80 for an oversized hand luggage because it could not fit into that measuring thing just before you board. Staff were so rude and unprofessional. I will never fly with this airline again. We were a family of 5 and the children were crying because mum could not travel with us because of bleach which was not even in the bag. Holiday spoiled, mid air on way back on 9th of September rude staff, had to literally beg for a blanket for my disabled son. Please don’t use this airline l feel cheated. For a family of 5 I would rather use Emirates even though it’s longer. Never again.

Aug,2022.0,The WORST flight experience in my life was my return flight from Abidjan to Bahrain with Ethiopian Airlines!,Abidjan,Bahrain International Economy,"The worst flight experience in my life was my return flight from Abidjan to Bahrain with Ethiopian Airlines! Never have I experienced such unprofessional, incompetent and directly RUDE staff! I highly recommend you TO AVOID Ethiopian Airlines. First of all, the only let passengers know that the first flight from Abidjan to Addis Ababa was cancelled 4 hours AFTER planned departure. After this, still no information about the rest of our journey for us passengers with connecting flights. Only the day after when a new flight from Abidjan to Addis Ababa was coming (24 hours after cancelled one), they informed me that they had changed my booking to fly over Dubai and then to Bahrain with 'flydubai'. This will prolonge my flight time with 29 hours, and I now miss out on a full day at work. This itinerary appeared from my online booking but they did not give me any boarding pass or other kind of documentation. They just told me to deal with it in Dubai. Arriving in Dubai at 3am well in advance of my flight with flydubai scheduled for 7:15am, turns out that NO ONE from Ethiopian Airlines had actually made any booking for me at all! The staff from flydubai tells me that their only chance to rebook me is the night flight at 17:00 thus I could look forward to another 10 hours in Dubai airport. This is not possible for me already dead-tired and supposed to be at work. I therefore run back to the gate where Ethiopian Airlines is boarding the flight back to Addis Ababa. there was a full queue of people waiting to board the flight back to Addis Ababa. I patiently joined the end of the queue and waited until it got my turn. I kindly told one of the Ethiopian Airlines staff that once he had finished with boarding the passengers, I had a claim. However, once the full flight was boarded the staff I had been talking to, turned to his Ethiopian airlines colleagues and start chatting and laughing, COMPLETELY ignoring me. I burst out into tears. I felt neglected and ridiculed. They then casually left the gate, leaving me behind with NO flight to my final destination. I was literally stranded in Dubai!!! It was only because I begged an Dubai airport staff present at the gate to help me out. He offered me to sit in the airport lounge and the airport's cost because he said that Ethiopian Airlines is never willing to offer anything for their stranded passengers. The friendly airport staff finally got me another flight at 12:55. I thus landed to my final destination, 47 hours after I first arrived in Abidjan and 28 hours after my departure. However, the worst part was my 10 HOURS in Dubai airport where I for 7 HOURS did not know when I would be flying back home. If it was not for the friendly airport staff who reacted to my crying, I would still be in Dubai airport.",3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Sep,2022.0,DO NOT FLY ETHIOPIAN!!!!,Cape Town Central,Washington DC International Economy,"I’m a frequent international traveler and can say without a doubt Ethiopian Airlines is the absolute worst. The interior is gross, it needs a deep cleaning. Food crumbs and stains on the seats, between the seats, on the floor and the seat back pocket. I’ve never seen such a dirty plane. Oh… and check out the large, nasty brown drool stains on the pillow they handed out. I asked for a clean pillow and they gave me another one with another drool stain lmao. So clearly they are reusing the pillows without washing. So freaking disgusting, especially during Covid times. I find it hilarious that they made the passengers stay masked on the flight but handed out unsanitary, used pillows. Cool. Many things also broken on the plane, my usb charger at my seat was broken, the inflight entertainment is super buggy (and the movie selection SUCKED), seat back pockets are falling off the seats. The interior looks run down as hell. I booked a window, nope it was switched to aisle. Food is not good and it’s the same for every single meal- rice and meat and a roll with butter. That sucked after 17.5 hours (yes the flight was that long). No ice for drinks and they don’t give enough drinks period- I was so thirsty. That has never happened to me before on a long haul flight. And to top it off they lost one of my checked bags. Customer service is non existent. Flight attendants are not very pleasant either. I booked with Ethiopian because it was the cheapest option but sometimes cheap is not worth it. For the love of god save yourself some misery and don’t book Ethiopian.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Also the airline wouldn’t even bother to assist me with trying to find new flights. I had to book them online on My own.

Oct,2022.0,service has been utterly shocking,Muscat,Johannesburg,"From the minute I crossed the boarding gate to now I have had a terrible experience with Ethiopian Airlines. Firstly my flight in Oman was delayed by 40 minutes, this meant when I arrived in Ethiopia I had to run to catch my connecting flight. The Addis Ababa airport is an absolute nightmare - a bottle neck of thousands and thousands of people squeezing and pushing trying to all get through security. I nearly missed my flight to Johannesburg. When I get onto the plane I realise I did not have the same seat I booked - when I went through the gate where they scan your ticket I was given a different ticket by the person at the counter but I didn't think anything of it. This person did not even bother to tell me he was moving me from a front row aisle seat to a third row middle seat. When I asked the air hostess why my seat had been moved she said they had a VIP they had to give my seat to. I felt absolutely disrespected - like I did not matter - how could they just move me to a middle back seat without even speaking to me about it? The food on the flight was terrible - I could not even eat it - I had two bites because I was so hungry but left the rest. The food was so dry and tasteless, and really just not good at all. Both of the planes also had really weird smells on them. When I landed in South Africa (after being awake for 37 hours) I stood at the carousal for over an hour waiting for my bag but it did not come out. Thanks to my airtag I could see that my bag was still in Ethiopia. I was so exhausted, dirty and so angry that I just burst into tears - the man at the EA counter did not know what to do with me. He assured me that I could go buy clothes and toiletries for $80 and I could just claim it back from Ethiopia Airlines. Although this was a huge inconvenience because I was leaving for Cape Town 2 days later, I felt better knowing they would fit the bill for the extra things I had to go buy. My bag only arrived 29 hours later and the lock on my bag was also broken. I submitted my claim two and a half months ago and have still not received my reimbursement or any feedback from them. I have sent so many emails following up on my reimbursement and I have had no response. I have also filled out an online form on their website and have sent a message to their Facebook page.

I followed the instructions and went upstairs to the office and met the person responsible to get the OK to travel. I equally explained that I have been travelling to Brazil and this is the first time I was asked to get an OK to travel despite my permanent residence permit. He insisted that I need that. I spoke to another Ethiopian who is a staff and he said same thing. I was running out of time. I spent hours explaining and no one listened. I was told to go back and wait for the OK to trave permit. And rebook my flight and the extra cost if any will be one me. The check-in was closing as the flight boarding announcement was made. I became so sad and depressed. I came downstairs to pick my luggage to go back home. Fortunately, there was another lady at the passport checking point and I walked up to her to give my last complaint. She was so surprised that a staff sent me to get an OK to travel when I have a permanent residence permit in Brazil. She scanned my passport and ordered the last person at the check-in desk to check me in immediately. I ran all the way through immigration to be able to catch up before the boarding gate was closed.

Till now, no one from the airline is willing to help us with our case. With the large volume of flights and lack of procedures to manage customers I gave up with this and anything to do with Ethiopian Airlines. The Addis Ababa airport is also another story.

Nov,2022.0,Criminals operating on Ethiopian Airways Flights,Addis Ababa,Dubai International Economy,"My wife and I took a flight from Addis Ababa arriving in Dubai early hours of the morning. When we arrived at our accommodation and began unpacking, we discovered items missing from our hand luggage. By the time we were done assessing the extent of our losses we found that two out of three of our handbags were tampered with and our cash and my wife's jewellery were stolen. I immediately contacted my local Ethiopian Airlines office to report it and they told me to report it to the airport authority instead. While I understand that this may be normal procedure, I felt the airline should at least show some interest in such a matter as it affects passenger safety instead of immediately referring me to another agency. They don't even seem to have any channel for receiving such complaint from my search through their website and interaction with their staff. This experience is a very bitter one and has left us feeling very disappointed that we cannot take future flights and relax in comfort that we are safe. I strongly advise travellers to take extra care of their belongings on-board long-haul flights as it is my belief that criminals are operating on these flights in coordinated manner and taking advantage of fellow passengers when they fall asleep during the flight. The items stolen from our bags were done in a way that would be difficult to spot until we were out of the aircraft by when it is too late to raise alarm.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Nov,2022.0,Worst Airline in the world,Chicago,Addis Ababa International Economy,"For starters the plane is old and raggedy and makes a lot of noise. Probably shouldn’t even be allowed to fly. Second all of the flight attendants are rude And honestly i think most of them are racist against anyone non-Ethiopian. 13 hour flight they give you two small cups of beverage and get attitude when you ask for more like it’s coming out of their check. One flight attendant was the only one actually doing her job. Kids were playing in the bathroom and completely ripped the door off, but people were still going in the bathroom and urinating with the door open, not a flight attendant in sight. To be quite honest i wouldn’t have never flown Ethiopian airways if they weren’t a star alliance partner as I’m a gold member with United and my uncle is also on board so i will be reporting this at the next star alliance meeting, as this aircraft or staff doesn’t meet star alliance quality standards I’m sure not their customer service standards. This airlines has more negative reviews than positive. I need everyone going forward to file a formal complaint and make sure to get names as i did, then take it a step further and submit a formal complaint to star alliance, as well as the FAA in regards to some of the safety issues/concerns.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

This was on 11/15/22. The air frame was creaking throughout the flight, there was water leaking at the main door to the plane and water leaked into the cabin during the flight as well. The seats were very hard and uncomfortable. The plane seemed to be 30 years old. I wonder why it's deemed airworthy. The return trip on 11/20/22 was slightly better, because the aircraft used was an improvement of sorts - no leaks into the cabin and no creaking of the air frame, but the seats were still very hard. I actually have back pain today, 11/26/22, mainly as a result of sitting on those hard seats for 10+ hours each way. I think Ethiopian has serious issues with the quality and age of it's planes, and they shouldn't mistreat an disrespect passengers going to African destinations by using very old aircraft.",3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor
Nov,2022.0,Worst Airline I Have Flown,Washington DC,Kilimanjaro National Park International Economy,"I flew from Dulles airport (Washington DC) to Kilimanjaro airport via Addis Ababa, then back to Dulles from Zanzibar via Addis Ababa for a safari and beach vacation in Tanzania. I flew economy on the way there, and business class from Addis Ababa to Dulles on the way back. This is by far the worst airline I've ever flown. The economy flight from Dulles to Africa: It was 13 hours. The airplane itself was in less-than average condition. My seat did not recline. There was a screaming infant behind me who not only kicked my chair the whole way to Africa but at one point reached over the seat and pulled my hair so hard some of it came out, all while the father laughed. The food was quite bad-gristly beef curry with rice. We were seated at a bulkhead --seats we'd paid an extra $99 for as ""premium"" seats -- and after takeoff a man from a couple of rows behind us came up and stacked one large piece of luggage and one large backpack right in front of me so that I had no leg room. When I complained to him he acted like he didn't understand me and left the bags there. When I told the flight attendant she ignored me and did nothing about it. When it was time for landing and everything was supposed to be stowed up above the flight attendants still did nothing about this luggage and I had to flag one down -- I wasn't going to let these bags that weren't even mine fly in my face and hurt me upon landing. She was very irritated to be bothered but finally told the man he had to move the luggage. He put it in his seat and STOOD IN THE AISLE for landing. Unbelievable. There seemed to be a number of people on the plane who are very unfamiliar with the rules/etiquette of flying. It was very noisy. The plane from Addis Ababa to Kilimanjaro was in a bit better shape, but my tv thing did not work. The food was equally bad. There were no a/c vents above the seats on either flight and it got quite hot. Both flights did leave on time, and boarding processes were smooth -- I'll give them that. Flights home from Zanzibar to Addis Ababa, and Addis to Dulles: We were in economy class from Zanzibar to Addis Ababa, which made sense as it was a relatively short flight. Bad food, inattentive service, tv in my chair did not work -- again. But got to Addis fairly quickly. Because we had bid on upgrades for the Addis to Dulles flight and gotten the business class tickets we went to the Cloud 9 lounge at the Addis Ababa airport. They printed out our boarding passes for us. The lounge is very large, but it nevertheless got very, very crowded and loud. I went to go into the quiet room to rest for a bit but a young mother had decided to use that room as a playroom for her two very young boys, who were running around, yelling, and playing loud video games -- so much for the quiet room. They did have plentiful free food. Business class on the flight home was much, much better than coach, obviously, but not as nice as business class on other planes. The best feature is that you can get your seat about 97% flat. So I was able to sleep much of the trip home. They give you a pillow, and blanket and a small toiletry kit. That flight is interrupted by a fuel stop in Dublin halfway though, so you will have to wake up with the lights on and sit your seat all the way up. The dinner served shortly after we got on the plane was pretty bad. But the ""lunch ""(inexplicably served at what I think was about 4am Washington DC time as we got close to DC) was traditional Ethiopian food and it was very good. The entertainment center / tv screens are kind of hard to figure out, working them with the remote isn't easy, and they are supposed to be touch screen but the touch screen feature didn't work on mine (didn't work on my husband's either). Again, no air vents on either flight and it got quite hot. I've never been on planes that didn't have those little air vents -- but none of my Ethiopian airplanes had them. The ""bidding"" process for upgrades was something I wasn't crazy about. You bid on upgrades and when someone outbids you they let you know so that you increase your bid. This went on and on and I imagine they got a lot more money this way -- by basically getting passengers into bidding wars with each other for upgrades. Now comes the part I'm really irritated about. My bag did not arrive back in the States. My husband's bag did, and mine did not. We filled out a claim at the airport with an Ethiopian Airlines representative in the baggage area. I discover when I get home, after making my lost bag report at the airport, that in order to track my lost bag on their website I was supposed to have been given a property irregularity report (PIR) number -- and I was not given one. I contacted the Dulles Ethiopian Airlines manager by email (the only relevant email I could find on the website) and he forwarded my email to someone else cc'ing me asking them to look into it. I've heard nothing back. I was told my bag would be delivered to my house within 24 hours. It's now been almost 36 and no bag and no email with any information about where it is. I am afraid, especially given the other reviews I see here, that it was likely just stolen rather than lost in transit. So I doubt it is coming. I will never fly this airline again and very much recommend against it. Not worth it. Find another way to get to your destination in Africa.",2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Nov,2022.0,Good stuff,Stockholm,Kigali International Business Class,"The lounge in Stockholm by SAS was OK but nothing to brag about. The aircraft to Adis was a Boeing 787 with fully flat seats and lots of storage space for hand luggage. Food onboard was good with ample choices. The food in the lounge at Adis is really sumptuous. In addition to international dishes it also offers a selection of Ethiopian dishes that were very tasty. Amenities includes silent room for sleeping, showers and massage. The direct flight from Adis to Kigali was replaced by a flight via Burundi. This delayed us by 2 - 3 hours, but we did not mind so much because the flight turned out to also be by a Boeing 787 (instead of the much smaller Airbus that would have normally been used).

Con's Although the website and the mobile app are looking good and are quite easy to use, for some reasons, it's impossible to add anything on your booking: meals, seats, ... It's impossible even to change the currency in which the prices are displayed. All these must be done through their contact center. Even a flight change notification must be confirmed via contact center. The good thing is that I waited for less than 1 minute each time I called them before I could speak to an operator.

Dec,2022.0,One of the worst airlines I have encountered,Chicago,Dubai,"One of the worst airlines I have encountered. My husband and I were supposed to take a trip from Chicago to Dubai connecting through Addis Ababa with Ethiopian airlines. We got to the airport well ahead of time, checked our baggage and got to the gate for our flight. We were told the flight was delayed but wasn't given any other information. We waited around for a few hours and were told to wait in the lounge. Waited again for a while, and my husband went to the airline counter only to find out the flight was cancelled due to some mechanical issue. We were told to go home and to come back the next day to be put on an 11am flight. We asked for our checked baggage back but Ethiopian airlines wouldn't give it back. We showed up to the airport the next day at 6am only to find out the mechanical issue was still going on and Ethiopian airlines didn't know when it would be fixed. They asked all the passengers to write down their email addresses on a piece of paper and that they would contact us when they had more information. At this point, we had already lost 2 days of our 10 day multi-city vacation. We went to United airlines (as our flight was a codeshare airline) and they managed to cancel our Ethiopian airlines ticket and were able to find us a last minute flight to Dubai. We went back to Ethiopian airlines to get our checked baggage back for the new flight and they refused to give the baggage as they claimed it had cleared security and they didn't have enough ""manpower"" to unload the luggage. Ethiopian airlines reassured us that that checked baggage would follow us to Dubai. We even let them know that we would only be in Dubai for another 3 days since we would be traveling to another destination after that, yet Ethiopian airlines assured us that our baggage would get to us. We got to Dubai and filed a baggage claim there. We waited for our baggage to arrive and even went back to Dubai airport only to find out the baggage was missing. We had to do a 14 day trip without our checked baggage and spend a good portion of our trip trying to buy a new suitcase, new clothes, etc. I'm very disappointed with Ethiopian Airlines.",3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

Dec,2022.0,will never used Ethiopian Airlines again,London,Harare,"This is the worst airline ever. My experience flying with Ethiopian Airlines was awful. From check in at Heathrow airport the staff were rude, service very slow. I had to pay for excess luggage, the agent at the ticket office counter seemed confused and she was very slow. Once we boarded, when dinner was served the only 2 options were either rice and fish or pasta and tomato sauce. As I am allergic to fish the only option for me was the pasta and tomato sauce. I asked for another meat option and I was told that chicken was "" finished"" . So I had to eat the pasta which was not well cooked with tomato sauce as I was hungry otherwise I wouldn't have eaten it. The airport upon landing in Addis Ababa was another experience, separate issue. I connected to Harare from Addis Ababa. Upon arrival in Harare I got 1 of my checked in bag and the other one was missing.

So my bag was missing, there was no announcement from the crew that some bags has been left behind, no communication whatsoever. I don't live in Harare, I had to stay in Harare overnight so I could return to the airport the following day to check whether my missing bag was on the next day's flight. Fortunately my bag came on that day's flight, however there was still no communication from the airline or apology whatsoever after the inconvenience.

I asked to see her manager and was told there was none. After getting very angry she went off and returned over 15 minutes later and said everything had been arranged and the seats were allocated. Imagine the shock my parents got when to check in and were given separate seats and not the pre-paid ones. This happened on both legs of the journey.

We arrived in Bangkok to discover 1 of our 3 pieces of luggage had not made it off the plane. Spent the next 5 days trying to make contact with EAL. They made no effort to contact me, no effort to respond to my many emails, calls and voicemails. Eventually my travel agent managed to get the name of a manager called ‘Jerry’ who confirmed he had located the bag in Jakarta and gave a personal commitment to get the luggage back to my hotel within the next 24 hours. He promised to provide updates and gave a contact number - and then promptly disappeared. Number provided went straight to voicemail. I then found a centralised call centre number and spent an entire day speaking to a number of poorly trained, rude and incompetent agents who all repeated the same line. “The bag will arrive at your hotel within 2 hours, we have confirmed with the manager at EAL Bangkok (“Mrs Eyersulam”) who will call you back immediately to confirm. She neither called, nor picked up the office phone - nor sent the luggage. I became increasingly exacerbated with the agents however they laughed when I told them my child’s medication was in the bag - and one of them put the phone down on me when I demanded to speak to a manager. So 6 days in Bangkok. No clothing , no toiletries , asthma meds - and still not 1 word back from EAL to me. Arrived at Bangkok airport yesterday to catch an outbound flight and on a whim decided to check lost luggage . And there was my luggage. The airport confirmed that no one from EAL had come to see them or checked for the bag - not once. Stay away! Pay more and use a recognised airline. You will not regret the decision. Check in at the start of the journey was diabolical. A 3 hour queue because the boarding staff are embarrassingly badly trained and cannot use the system. Flight delayed by an hour - not a word from the airline on why, or what we do about connecting flights. They just continued as if it was normal.

Flight canceled without informing me. We I call them because I wasn’t able to make the check-in online the day before the flight, they told me that it was canceled. Unacceptable! They take no responsibility! THEIR EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE CLIENT in INDIA handling the global phone calls is a mist! No assistance after more than 10calls for min. 45mins each! HIGHLY INCOMPETENT & PAINFUL! After 8 calls every 2hours (each call lasts at least 45mins) trying to get another solution, I got the confirmation that they put me on another flight that will leave in less than 2hours. I took the taxi to the airport right away but Of course it was too late so I missed that flight. Today, we are one day after the initial flight and I still don’t have a solution from Ethiopia Airlines. I do not know if I will travel to spend holiday with my family or not. Already missed the silvester time! In total, I called a million of times. For 1hour call you are on hold for 45mins. Sometimes the just cut off or hang up during a call. Every time you call you need to explain the whole story from the beginning again and again…awful & painful! They never call back the customer for helping finding a solution, no emails. The lied to me many times saying they will call me or will send e-mail but never do that. I am abandoned to myself and gave the Ethiopia Airlines case to my lawyer !

Dec,2022.0,Worst airline ever,Chicago,Dubai International Business Class,"One of the worst airlines I have ever encountered!! My husband and I were supposed to take a trip from Chicago to Dubai connecting through Adis Ababa with Ethiopian airlines. We got to the airport well ahead of time, checked our baggage and got to the gate for our flight. We were told the flight was delayed but wasn't given any other information. We waited around for a few hours and was told to wait in the lounge. Waited again for a while, and my husband went to the airline counter only to find out the flight was cancelled due to some mechanical issue. We were told to go home and to come back the next day to be put on an 11am flight. We asked for our checked baggage back but Ethiopian airlines wouldn't give it back. We showed up to the airport the next day at 6am only to find out the mechanical issue was still going on and Ethiopian airlines didn't know when it would be fixed. They asked all the passengers to write down their email addresses on a piece of paper and that they would contact us when they had more information. At this point, we had already lost 2 days of our 10 day multi-city vacation. We went to United airlines (as our flight was a codeshare airline) and they managed to cancel our Ethiopian airlines ticket and was able to find us a last minute flight to Dubai. We went back to Ethiopian airlines to get our checked baggage back for the new flight and they refused to give the baggage as they claimed it had cleared security and they didn't have enough ""manpower"" to unload the luggage. Ethiopian airlines reassured us that that checked baggage would follow up to Dubai. We even let them know that we would only be in Dubai for another 3 days since we would be traveling to another destination after that, yet Ethiopian airlines assured us that our baggage would get to us. We got to Dubai and filed a baggage claim there. We waited for our baggage to arrive and even went back to Dubai airport only to find out the baggage was missing. We had to do a 14 day trip without our checked baggage and spend a good portion of our trip trying to buy a new suitcase, new clothes, etc. I'm very disappointed with Ethiopian airlines and WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS AIRLINE TO ANYONE!",3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,TripAdvisor

From check in at Heathrow airport the staff were rude, service very slow. I had to pay for excess luggage, the agent at the ticket office counter seemed confused and she was very slow. Once we boarded, when dinner was served the only 2 options were either rice and fish or pasta and tomato sauce. As i am allergic to fish the only option for me was the pasta and tomato sauce. I asked for another meat option and i was told that chicken was "" finished"" . So i had to eat the pasta which was not well cooked with tomato sauce as i was hungry otherwise i wouldn't have eaten it. The airport experience upon landing in Addis Ababa was another experience, separate issue. I connected to Harare from Addis Ababa. Upon arrival in Harare i got 1 of my checked in bag and the other one was missing. The airport staff advised that it happens all the time- "" when the plane is full Ethiopian Airlines removes some random bags and they follow with the next flight"" . Shocking! So my bag was missing, there was no announcement from the crew that some bags has been left behind, no communication whatsoever! I dont live in Harare, i had to stay in Harare overnight so i could return to the airport the following day to check whether my missing bag was on the next day's flight. Fortunately my bag came on the next day's flight , however there was still no communication from the airline or apology whatsoever after the inconvenience and unplanned overnight expenses!

Today the best airlines are very creative in respecting their customers, especially in business class, but apparently not at Ethiopian Boarding is not distinct and the crowd prevents us from accessing the business class line when boarding, for example at ADD and JNB (it was a souk) The most serious, I had reserved the seats since August 2022 and between ADD and BRU I should have had an outside 4J and the manager changed my seat to me on boarding for the 4F it is between two people in the center of the row As this plane was almost 12 years old and the business class design is no longer suitable today, there is no separation between the seats so it is impossible to sleep there is always the head of your two neighbors Worse still, my 4J seat was given to a single passenger who was sick and coughed all night The question is how in times of covid and virus transmission did a sick person get on a plane?

The entertainment system was not working at my seat and my neighbour next to me. Service after take off was not friendly, only one crew had a smile on her face. One crew was not happy that she had to open a pack of passionfruit juice for me being in the last row that she overfilled the cup and handed it to me that the juice was leaking on my tray table and my neighbours. Had to ask a few times for a napkin to wipe the mess and she pretended not to hear. Finally handed the napkin without looking at me and no apology. And why is Ethiopian using plastic cutlery? On way back one of my checked bag did not arrive at my destination. I had perishables including meat products. Luggage arrived 24hrs later. Tried to file a claim for compensation but excuses given by the airline that they cannot accept the claim. Very disappointing experience.

Feb,2023.0,Eventually I did not board,Tokyo,Seoul,I had a round ticket booked from Tokyo to Seoul. My mistake was researching in time that I needed a special ETA for Korea. That's 100% my responsibility. I tried to rebook my departure flight but they only do so via the call centre. The first agent advised to book on their platform but not to proceed with payment as only the price difference to the old ticket would matter and call them again instead. hey do not send out a payment link. You're forced to give your credit card number over the phone - which is not very safe. Anyway my payment did not go through. So I had no other option than pay at the check in counter the next day. The price went up. The check in counter did communicate with customer service. Hence the price tripled in less than an hour. The person at the counter instead spent 30 minutes printing out all kind of airline policy to prove why passengers must pay XYZ fees. He could have spent this time trying to solve this issue by for example engaging with customer service and holding a price. Eventually I did not board. I cannot even recover my return flight as they are charging an additional $200 USD change fee.,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

Feb,2023.0,Never Again - Not worth the stress,Johannesburg,Paris International Economy,"his was my third time flying Ethiopian airlines. First time, the experience wasn’t great - the seats in economy are a bit cramped and there’s very little leg room. Second time, I flew business - it was good - food was amazing and people were hospitable. Third time was and will be my last time. The customer service is shocking - the people on the phone tell you one thing then in person or via email they tell you something else. No one seems to know what they’re doing - I wasn’t allowed to board due to people within the team not understanding their own processes. I was then told to reach out to customer service to get it sorted and they said they’d reach out to the ground staff and I should call the next morning to follow up and check in. What happened when I did? They had no idea what I was taking about. The customer service staff and ticketing staff are some of the rudest people I’ve ever had the misfortune of interacting with - they made an already stressful situation significantly moreso. And then on top of all that, I arrive to my final destination and find my perfumes which were too big for carry on missing from my luggage - one of which I never unpacked and the other I packed in front of my sister - and no way to report the missing items. Honestly, just spend the extra hundreds because in the long run I would’ve saved if I had just rebooked with a better airline. That said, the staff in the plane itself are incredibly pleasant and the food is decent so if you’re confident you’ll have no issues traveling and are willing to wrap your bag then it may be worth the gamble.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

A compensation was agreed, which they say was transferred to our bank account. However, we have never received it. After we insisted, they refused to look into the matter further and stopped replying to us. Our bank say the information they provided as evidence of their bank transfer is insufficient to investigate where the issue is. However, Ethiopian Airlines told us to ""look again"" implying that either we are lying or that we cannot even read our bank statements properly.

Feb,2023.0,Customer Service Appalling. WARNING Don't go near this airline.,London,Cape Town Central International Economy,"To be balanced I have to say that the flights themselves and the flight crew were good.. Its a great shame that the flights and the crew are so badly let down by the airline customer service and sales team. We booked flights 6 months ago via Addis Ababa for 6 persons with a 1 hour layover at Addis going and coming back. We found out by accident that they have a policy of overbooking seats so that they bumped one of our party off a flight 2 weeks before going, and offered a flight home 3 days later. No apologies or regret...in fact to say that the customer service team couldn't care less would be an understatement. So one of our party never made the wedding. The rest of us found out when checking in that they had changed the flight and we now had a 11 hour stopover in Addis. With 2 young children, no fun especially when they eventually after 2 hours queuing sent us to a dump somewhere the other side of the city where the bedroom door wouldn't even shut. I could go into more detail of all the problems, but Nightmare is the word. The real bottom line is that you can write to them and complain many times but they simply ignore you or don't even bother replying. SO MY ADVICE. DON'T GO NEAR THIS SHAMBLES OF AN AIRLINE COMPANY WITH A 50 METRE BARGE POLE. BE WARNED. you will regret it. .",4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Feb,2023.0,"Didn’t get ordered meal, food poisoning",Cape Town Central,Oslo International Economy,"I traveled with this airline from South Africa, landing in Ethiopia then straight to Norway, so with such a distance of course I would be needing food. While everyone gets their meals included on their flights, I had to pay extra for my vegan meals, and I ordered this months in advance. Hot food to be specific, because I really wanted to avoid food poisoning. At first, getting on the flight in economy class we were freezing as it was super cold, and the blankets we got was too thin to help much. We didn’t get much sleep that night. The staff was very hard to get a hold of, and they were not aware that I had ordered a vegan dinner. They didn’t apologize or tell me if they could do anything about it. They just left and after a while they put a plate of cold salad in front of me and ran off. I recognized that it was the same salad as included in the small boxes with the main meal, but I couldn’t eat this as it was too risky. The only thing I could eat was a cracker. When landing in Ethiopia, there was no time to get food because our flight was delayed so we barely had time to run to the toilet and get on the next flight. Again, I didn’t know if I was gonna get the mail so I ordered and I was very hungry. For some reason we got upgraded to business class, which was a really nice surprise and we were offered food very quickly. The crew came around to take our orders from a menu and after a look I asked if they had anything vegan. They didn’t answer and ran off after giving me a form. I had to fill out after giving me a form I had to fill out. There you had to answer what kind of breakfast and drinks you wanted - hot or cold, and you could be a little bit specific too. I started to feel that this was gonna work out after all. After a while, they came around serving us the evening dinner and I was pleasantly surprised when they had made me a warm meal with rice, cooked veggies in a tomato sauce with a dash of spinach. Simple, but I was happy. I also appreciate the tv and being able to customize the positioning of your seat to make yourself more comfortable. You could even but it all down and sleep with the help of a pillow and a thicker blanket. By the next morning, they still hadn’t collected the form so I woke up to being served the main breakfast. That included sliced fruits, a dairy yogurt, cereal (didn’t have plant milk), a tiny bagel, jam, and honey - most things I cannot eat. I ate the little bagel with the apricot jam and a few bites of the watermelon, but it wasn’t enough to fill my hunger. I didn’t make a big fuss out of everything because I know the staff is trying to do their job with the information they have and it’s probably not their fault that they didn’t know that I ordered warm, vegan food. I don’t know where, but somehow this information got lost and I didn’t get what I paid for. A short day after we came home my travel partner and I got very sick. We were diagnosed with food poisoning. My friend who didn’t think ate everything the crew offered vomited over 15 times and we had all the other symptoms that food poisoning gives you. It’s a shame this happened because we had everything planned in advance even paid extra to get our correct meals and we were very careful with food when we stayed in Africa, so we were fine up until the last day of a trip. There’s no doubt that it was the food we got on these flights that made us sick. As I said, not everything on the flight was negative. The crew at business class was very nice and the comfort here was definitely a lot better than at economy class. But I hope the airline can be more careful about special meals and the food they serve on these flights because food poisoning is serious and it can and you up in hospital.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

I travelled last night from Addis Ababa to Entebbe on ET 338, a short two hour flight with arrival at 0:55. Obviously something went completely wrong in Addis, because about 20 passengers did not get their luggage. Since I use Apple Air Tag to track my luggage, I could see that my bag was still in Addis. Therefore I filled out the lost luggage form and went to Kampala, 40 Minutes drive away, to my hotel. I looked this morning at the website „mybag.aero“ to find out that the data I filled in the form, did by far not correspond. The e-mail was not remotely that what I wrote down. My home address was completely mixed up, I all of a sudden reside now in Niger instead of Europe. But nevertheless I was pleased to see that my bag arrived with the first flight just after 11:00 am in Entebbe. I could track the bag at Entebbe Airport. The sad news is that now at 7:00 pm the bag is still in Entebbe, eight hours after arrival. This shows Ethiopian has no respect for the customers and does not care to rectify the mistake they obviously made. The Ethiopian Airport manager Mr.Talila is not reachable for any help. One should expect that a lost luggage is, when found, delivered as fast a possible back to the customer.

An avgeek like me won’t be disappointed. If only the route was earlier in the day so the approach and landing could be done in daylight—but that’s the pickiest thing. Moreover, it took a long time to collect my electric wheelchair in Stockholm, but I won’t count that as a failure on Ethiopian’s part. Arlanda is among the slowest and most inconvenient for wheelchair users bringing their equipment onboard planes, as there are so few service elevators from which to transport a wheelchair into the terminal. At first I panicked that my chair left ARN for Addis Ababa, but in reality it had been promptly unloaded, just sitting on the tarmac waiting for a team to haul it into an Ambilift and into baggage claim. The time I had to wait was extremely long…two hours at least. Come on, Arlanda. I would happily and excitedly fly Ethiopian again.

Mar,2023.0,Disaster of a trip. My last (after many) with Ethiopian,Mombasa,Toronto International Economy,"To whom it may concern, It has been two weeks since our most recent return from Mombasa via Addis Ababa to Toronto on 13 March 2023 – flight ET552 We have been flying Ethiopian Airlines for the past 10 years at least. The previous flights were October 2022 (myself to Johannesburg and return, my wife and 3 adults to Nairobi and return). My own experience in October 2022 was not a pleasant one (I likened the Addis to Toronto leg to a crowded suburban 2nd class train (but it lasted 14 hours). I put this off as a singular unfortunate event (they happen I accept). My wife and my flight back from Addis to Toronto on 13 March 2023 however was even worse. I have to rate it as the most frustrating travel experience in all of my 72 years of travel. We do visit Africa regularly but it is highly unlikely we can ever again consider Ethiopian despite it having the most convenient connections and a competitive fair. My first complaint was that despite trying 6 times we were unable to prebook – it took all the information and then advised there was an error with the tickets and the system was unable to process the booking (please contact your airline representative). We need to do this from our vacation house, no phone. I do realize there is little the airline can do to screen passengers. It is however your ground and air staff’s responsibility to ensure cleanliness and order during embarkation, the flight disembarking as well as cleanliness and hygiene during all of the journey. The stampede upon announcement of boarding was like a Mara migration. No one paid any attention to zones and crowded everywhere, we had to stand apart and stay far away as seniors. All zones tried to board simultaneously despite numerous appeals. There was very little control during boarding with the aisles being a free for all and backpacks swung in all directions, overhead holds crowded and being reorganized by passengers. The toilets I hate to say were a mess with urine on the floor each of the 6 times between us my wife and I went. She found the toilet blocked on two of her three visits. We were in row 19 but stampeded from behind and squashed (we just sat down) the moment the seatbelt sign was turned off for disembarking. The quality of the food and entertainment and staff service to our seats was good. You are going to have to work out some discipline (and enforcement/strict supervision) however during embarkation and disembarkation, keeping toilets clean and generally enforcing acceptable behavior in the aisles and the cabin. If not I am afraid many more will decline to fly Ethiopian and use the alternatives. I would be happy to discuss my experience and positive suggestions for making everyone’s flight more pleasurable. For now we will regrettably not be flying Ethiopian Airlines again. I sent a complaint to the airline on 21 March and have to date not had the courtesy of any reply or acknowledgement. Yours sincerely – Pieter and Cathy van Niekerk Ps – can I add that we took 4 other passengers to Kenya who returned on March 2, had similar experiences and have come to the same conclusions.",4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Another A350 and once again seat 11A however the seat had a fault so not too comfortable, crew where a bit vacant on this flight. The food a sandwich and lunch was again okay perhaps better than the first flight. Arrived CPT more or less on time after a flight of around 6 hours, bags delivered quickly so I suppose all in all Ethiopian got me from A to B & finally C without too much stress. I guess the one improvement would be the ground operation, it's pretty poor and rude at some points.

My mom travelled solo and he was very sick on the flight which caused her trauma not to fly again. The cabin crews and the pilots literally saved my mother. The cabin crews helped her even going to the wash room and extended the care and compassion she gets from her children. I salute this kind of gold heart and gold service that save life.

Apr,2023.0,Malawi airlines: Lack of reliability and customer orientation,Lilongwe,Lusaka Africa Economy,"I took Malawian airlines (subsidiary of Ethiopian airlines) flight ET 35 from Lilongwe to Lusaka. At the airport, they checked me in at 8:30 am. Then no news, no updates. I went to Malawian airlines counter myself at 10: 30 am, boarding time, and only at that point I learned that the aircraft (DHC-8) had been having technical problems since previous day, flights were cancelled previous day, with many stranded passengers since that day, equally totally in the dark. The airlinerepresentative told us that the ""fix"" was progressing positively, and the next update was expected two hours after the original departure time (12:30 pm). Then I learned from the airport staff that in fact Malawian airlines, a subsidiary of Ethiopian airlines with only two aircrafts (one Boeing 737 and one DHC-8) was ferrying Ethiopian airlines technical staff from Addis Ababa on Ethiopian airlines flight to check the aircraft and see if it can be fixed. That flight only arrives at 12:50 pm, so why was that update that ""the fix was progressing well""? Needless to say, there were no efforts to rebook passengers, nor to keep them updated. After a few hours of Ethiopian airlines technical staff arriving on Ethiopian airlines flight from Addis Ababa, it appears that the aircraft was flying again, Finally, at 17:30 pm, the flight ET 35 took off, 7 hours late, still no explanations, no compensations, no rebooking. Finally the pilot said a short apology. The lack of clarity, lack of transparency, as well as the lack of customer orientation are totally concerning.

I made a call to the Ethiopian Office in Kuala Lumpur. The staff mentioned that it is the airline policy not to attend any claim after the item was received. This is quite ridiculous as the airline made my luggage missing that caused a lot of trouble for me as a passenger to travel 50km back to the airport just to claim my luggage and later to found out that my luggage was damaged. This is not acceptable as the airline is not taking the responsibility for the damaged, they have done. This is a bad service as a Star Alliance airline.

Skylight is the most luxurious and the largest hotel in Ethiopia located just five minutes away from Bole International Airport. On arrival at the airport, Ethiopian Airlines officials completely disregarded the voucher. They told me I was going to sleep at Adot-Tina Hotel. I had no choice. I wish they could give me the option to pay for my own accommodation, but it appears Ethiopian Airlines has business links with some of the shabbiest hotels in Addis Ababa, to which they force you to go. After a long wait at the queue, we got out of the airport, hoping to be taken swiftly to this Adot-Tina Hotel. But no, we were made to wait for more than 30 minutes outside the airport, where it was drizzling and there was nowhere to take cover. Eventually the shuttle from Adot-Tina came, only to start making us wait again. I had to plead with the driver to take us to the hotel as we were super-tired. Finally he relented. The hotel, my God. The shabbiest place I have ever been in. I could not sleep at all. I felt deeply insulted by Ethiopian Airlines. In future, I will only fly Ethiopian if I have no choice.

Apr,2023.0,Worst airline EVER. Not not ounce professional. Reviewers give it a free pass because its black owned,Shanghai,Santa Cruz International Economy,My friend checked in Shanghai to go to Bolivia as final destination transit via Addis Abab and Sao Paulo. In Shanghai airport his luggage was checked in all the way to the final destination. However once the flight arrived to Addis Abab they wouldn't let him board his next flight to Sao Paulo. They said he needed a brazil visa. But he has a connecting flight in with a 3 hour layover and he will only stay in the transit area of that airport so by brazilian law he DOESN'T need one. Something the counter in Shanghai verified before letting him board. He wasnt able to board they lost his luggage and made him wait 10 hours in a room changing agents every 3 hours or so. Then the story starts charging. -The first agent asks for the reservation to be together on a single booking.(Which was originally the case but then couldnt board his flight anyway) -2nd agent asks for Bolivian visa which is not needed and can be arranged via Visa on arrival. Still no go -3rd agent comes and this where it becomes absurd and stupid he asks for the flight to be directly it cannot have different boarding passes. ?🤯 The boarding passes are under the same airline (Ethiotrash) only the final leg is under BOA but he wants a boarding pass from Addis abab all the way to Bolivia. (There are no direct flights like that) And if he knew anything about travel he would know small countries rely mainly on transit via major hubs. In the end nobody wants to help. Their requirements keep changing. They dont even want to accept a booking flight to Qatar just to get out of that airport which doesnt require Visa or any hurdles. The worst experience so far because since my friend speaks bare english he had to beg them to hand the phone so i could speak with them and in most cases they refused. The 2 times I managed to get into a conversation they spoke over me and didnt let me even speak then gave the phone back. I need to put this out there because it really annoys me how this airline is getting free passes on reviews and articles just because its african pride owned. Here comes the worst part. They want him to pay his ticket back to China after they lost his luggage after they let him board in Shanghai and after making him wait for absolutely nothing. Not even a sorry for not verifying further. Any other airline and this BS wouldn't even be an issue since I did similar flights before via Qatar-Sao Paulo-Bolivia Instanbul - Sao Paulo-Argentina no transit visa needed.

The Dreamliner[787] aircraft was lovely and modern inside with nice crew, the food served was decent and served quickly on all flights and the crew were very nice too. However my flights on the 737 weren't as good, firstly the JNB-ADD flight is usually served by a 787 however this was changed last minute and I was not informed, doing a 5 hour overnight flight on a 737 was not nice, the legroom was very bad for a flag carrier airline and was lucky no one was sat next to me otherwise I would've struggled. The crew thought it would a great idea to wake everyone up at 1am for a dinner service which was crazy to me as nearly everyone around was trying to sleep, they even put the brightest cabin lights on ruining mine and most people's sleep. The flight deck on my flight from ADD-SEZ took a worrying amount of time to take off, we used 90% or so of the runway for a 737 which was very concerning. Then the flight deck from SEZ-ADD touched down fine however they slammed their brakes on so hard, it threw many people forward into the seats in front of them, the reason they did this was to exit onto a taxiway closer to the terminal to save time which in my opinion was a very selfish decision, I could even smell smoke from the brakes.

May,2023.0,So-So Experience,Newark,Lome International Economy,"The best thing about Ethiopian Airlines is its inclusion in the Star Alliance Program. For me, this meant I was able to use my United Airlines FF membership to earn miles between Newark, NJ to Lome, Togo, and then on to CDG in Paris. Ethiopian was the only airline that I found that flew non-stop to Lome, Togo. All other flights were routed through Europe, mainly Paris which more than doubled travel time. I felt that the cost of the ticket was very reasonable. If you fly into Newark, you have to break security to get to the Gate Area. The area was dark and while clean of debris and trash, had the feeling of being ""dirty."" Options for food and drink vendors were very limited. The aircraft was an older 787-8, The distance between the seats was greater than economy seats in the US domestic market. The width was ok, but not great. Now the airlines have a program that they call Sheba, in which you may buy the seats next to you, at least between Newark and Lome. I paid about $100 each for 2 extra seats and had the invoice showing it, however, my boarding pass only showed one. The on-board staff said for me to get a refund on the one seat, I'd have to contact their Customer Service desk. It turns out that no one sat in my row, so in essence, I did get what I paid for. The same program was offered between Lome and Paris, which was free, however, even though I selected the free seat, the aircraft was full and my request was not honored. Food Service in Economy was better than on Condor Airlines but not as good on other International Flights I have been on. The flight attendants weren't rude, but they weren't friendly either. The beverage service after the meal/beverage service was very poor. On my flight between Lome and Paris, I had to get up and get my own while two attendants were seated, talking with each other and ignoring me. I responded to an in-flight medical event. Their onboard first-aid kit was very poorly stocked and looked like it hadn't been checked in years.

An Ethiopian Airlines staff member told me off for being in the wrong queue, confiscated my boarding pass, refused to give it back and when I insisted he said 'Act your age'. He was arrogant, insolent and humiliated me in front of all the other passengers. Does Ethiopian no longer train your staff on appropriate customer service?

Jun,2023.0,Literally the worst flying experience I have ever had,Atlanta,Dar es Salaam International Economy,"Literally the worst flying experience I have ever had. To be fair, I don't fly very often, but my brother recalled a time that I accidentally brought pepper spray on a flight and he said that if my pepper spray had exploded mid-flight, it still would've been a better experience than we had with Ethiopian Airlines. The flight itself was perfectly fine. However, the flight left three hours late with hardly any explanation. Because the flight left so late, we missed our connecting flight in Addis Ababa. My brother who bought his ticket separately from the rest of the family was put on a flight 12 hours later and the rest of the family was put on a flight 24 hours later. When my brother landed, his checked baggage wasn't at the airport. We had assumed that it would arrive with the rest of the family's baggage but instead NONE of our 12 checked bags made it to Dar es Salaam. And, due to Ethiopian Airlines' 7 kilo limit on carry-on luggage, we could barely fit any clothes inside the carry-ons so we're left with hardly any clothing. To make things even worse, the entire reason we were going to Dar es Salaam was for my brother's wedding and the checked luggage contained almost everyone's wedding clothes. The value of our missing luggage is in the thousands. I would be more forgiving if there was anything that my family could've done differently to have a better experience, but every single issue that we faced was the fault of Ethiopian Airlines. A few smaller, less consequential (and admittedly nit-picky) details include: - The airline said that they would have vegan meal options but both breakfast and dinner didn't have anything vegan beyond crackers and cookies. - Every single movie (with English audio, I didn't check any other audio options) had closed captioning in Chinese that couldn't be turned off and you couldn't switch the language. - In the tab to listen to music, there were only three albums in the rock selection which were by Wheatus, System of a Down, and Bowling for Soup. - The bathroom didn't have any soap.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

It’s unbelievably unorganized (no lines, swarms of people who don’t know where they’re going from the start and no one directing - a lady of the counter also full on yelled at me because I asked her a question 6 minutes before the counter window opened….). We then took off an hour late, just sitting on the plane, with no reasoning - until 45 minutes into waiting they gave an update. Why can’t you update people and let us know what is going on within a reasonable amount of time? So people don’t get annoyed for no reason? Also, this was an 8 hour flight that took off at 9PM (10:10 with the delay) . They literally didn’t come around with anything, including water, for the first 3.5 hours in air. Pack food & water! Then, everyone on that plane was trying to sleep (with it being 10PM and all….) yet they kept full lights on the entire time - up until the last 2 hours? Bizarre. And seriously sucks for people like us who needed that 8 hours to sleep on our 32 hours journey…. We were so confused why they wouldn’t let people sleep? We ended up buying lounge access at the airport so we could get an hour in at least after, and before our next leg. Then a woman had her kid throw up right in front of us, she quickly ran and asked for water… and they said “sorry, we’re busy at the moment”. Soooo, it smelled like puke and the kid cried significantly longer that what was necessary. Given they barely offer you anything in flight, you’d think someone would be able to help her?? Lastly, these seats are insane for international travel. It felt like I was on a commuter plane going from OC to SF, cramped as could be, for 8 hours. Even United international has more space! I’m 5’3” and literally couldn’t stretch my legs out the entire flight. I’ve never left a flight so poorly rested and knotted up from zero room (they JAM those planes full of seats).

Jul,2023.0,seat I had reserved was no longer available,Dubai,Cape Town,"During my flight in July 2023, a delay occurred. The cabin crew assured us that the connecting flight would wait for Cape Town passengers and that ground staff had been informed. However, upon arriving at Addis airport, I found chaos with numerous delayed passengers and inadequate hotel accommodations arrangements. Furthermore, my in-transit luggage was missing for four hours, adding further inconvenience and the seat I had reserved was no longer available. I must highlight the unsatisfactory state of the toilets. One toilet was blocked, while another had accumulated years of sticky waste on the seat rim. Additionally, the cabin crew's uncooperative attitude in providing essential items for passengers, such as swallowing tablets or providing wipes for hand cleanliness, was concerning. Excessive noise from the kitchen area and lack of attention to passenger needs were also noticeable. I would acknowledge the contrasting experience provided in business class. I upgrade occasionally, or buy extra Shebamiles for upgrading or use Shebamiles. This is where passengers receive amenities like hot towels, menus, and recommendations regarding available choices. As a loyal customer who has flown with ET since 2011, I am disappointed to see the evident disparity in treatment between economy and business class passengers.

During my recent flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to Dubai, my friend and I checked in and received our boarding passes and luggage stickers. However, when we tried to load our luggage, we were told to go back to the line and check our tourist visa. We went to another counter to verify our visa with the agent name Meron Teklay (I appreciate her handling and she is well experienced) and then returned to the agent to drop off our bags, as we had our boarding passes and luggage stickers. Unfortunately, the agent was rude and refused to let us drop off our luggage, instructing us to go back to the line. It's frustrating that we completed all the necessary procedures but were still not allowed to proceed. I am aware that the Ethiopian government invested a significant amount of money in a smart checking system, but it seems like it is not being utilized effectively. I have personally traveled multiple times with a permanent residence permit for the United States of America and hold Silver Sheba miles status. This experience with Ethiopian Airlines on July 8, 2023, was the worst in terms of customer handling.

Jul,2023.0,ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES NEVER ADDRESSES PROBLEMS!,Addis Ababa,Cairo North Africa,"I was hesitant to write this review because I support legitimate African business enterprises. ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES seems great until there is a problem, and then the airline is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. They NEVER address any problems, from loss items, mis-routed luggage, or group sales. They politely (but systematically) IGNORE addressing any issues, but simply disappear from the communication and find a way to either blame the customer or escape responsibility. The airline is more interested in taking consumer money at the moment with no concern of any long-term business with customers. In the last incident in July 2023, the airline representative at Bole Airport (Addis Ababa) *misrouted* my check-in bag to Cairo instead of directly to JFK (NY), and the airline took no responsiblity for this error which cost me an extra 26 hours of travel and about $900, after I had to change plans and stay in Cairo to retrieve my bag. I had to buy a Egypt transit visa, stay in a hotel, and book a new flight from JFK back home to California. Rather than offering a travel voucher or a travel upgrade on a future flight, Ethiopia Airlines took the low road as usual and made a phoney offer of a ""complimentary flight change."" In decades of traveling internationally I have never had to change my flight (until their error last summer), so this phoney ""offer"" allows Ethiopian Airlines to make an error which costs me time and money, take no responsbiily (which they are experts in doing), and not pay a dime in compensation. Their phoney ""offer"" is to present a scenario that will almost never happen, rather than respecting the customer and at least meeting me half way. Ethiopian Airlines is a multiple-billion dollar airline but is more interested in saving a few dollars than respecting cusomers and addressing problems. BEWARE OF ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES, because after you get past the initial hospitality and smiles, you will find that they don't address ANY problems, and always wants the customer to pay the cost of their mistakes and very poor behind-the-scenes organization.

My flight departed late from Doha. 45 minutes later. That meant I would miss my layover. Luckily we made the time up in the air. But if we didn't, I would miss my flight all in all... At Addis all you have to do is listen and be fast paced. There is this guy I saw both time during my incoming and outgoing flights from their airport. All he does is shout and direct you. He is the man to look for. He'll be shouting and that's where you need to go. I made it through the airport and security checks in time don't be shy to run. They lost my bag but it was returned about two days later intact. You can track when your bag has been put on the flight or not through the application. Both bags were safe when I returned from CPT back to Doha. On the return as well, they picked us directly off the flight and asked us to stand aside. They will transport you on the tarmac when you have the 30 minute return flight. The second flight did not have a screen but I prepared for that with my laptop.

Jul,2023.0,Ethiopian Airlines is lacking in all areas,Victoria,Washington DC International,"I recently flew on Ethiopian Airlines from Seychelles to Dulles Airport in the United States. I would first like to thank the staff of Ethiopian Airlines in Seychelles. They were very accommodating in working with the Seychelles government so that we could be guests of the president and meet our flight on time. They worked well with all the government officials. However, once leaving Seychelles, our experience turned for the worse. All passengers were not created equal. While I can appreciate that the staff took care of their fellow citizens but do not neglect the passengers who are not Ethiopian. I felt unwanted and unseen. Customer service was lacking. Let's talk about the airplane itself. The aircraft was old and reminded me of the planes of the late 70s and early 80s. The seats were small, but we did upgrade due to the much-needed legroom. Business class is subpar compared to other airlines but was definitely needed on a long flight. I travel with a large group all over the world. We received subpar service. Arriving at Addis Ababa Airport was a complete nightmare. I appreciate the security, but standard operating procedures were inefficient, and we wasted valuable time. Once getting off the plane, we went through security. While in the airport terminal, we had to go through another checkpoint before sitting at our gate. Some family members were checked a third time. A women security officer felt up the bosom area at the third check, warranting a traumatic experience for a family member. We observed more foreigners going through the third checkpoint than Ethiopian Nationals. While we were at our gate, we wanted to get food. Although we were still in the terminal, we were not allowed outside the gate area to get food. The gate area only has a bathroom, and no food is permitted. We had 17 more hours before arriving in America, and we were hungry, and some people had low blood sugar levels. We tried to upgrade our seats to business class at the gate and were told it was outside the gate area on the other side of security, but they would not allow us to leave the area. We had eight (8) people that needed to upgrade, and they did not want to send someone to the gate area to do that. We finally convinced them to do the upgrades at the gate. I encourage Ethiopian Airlines and the Addis Ababa Airport to review their standing operating procedures and customer service.

The flight was canceled not once, not twice, but an astonishing five times, leaving my family and me stranded without any assistance or support from the airline. First and foremost, the constant flight cancellations were deeply frustrating and bewildering. Our travel plans were repeatedly disrupted, leaving us in a state of perpetual uncertainty. The lack of communication from Ethiopian Airlines further exacerbated the situation, with no clear information provided regarding the reasons for the cancellations or any alternative arrangements. Adding to our misery, the airline's failure to provide any on-ground assistance during these trying times was utterly disappointing. After the fifth cancellation, we found ourselves stranded at the airport during the late hours of the night, with no available taxi services to take us to a nearby hotel or any food options to address our basic needs.

Interestingly according to the Airline the items left on board are not subject to the lost luggage policy and generally are not dealt with by the Lost and found department, i.e you cannot submit a “loss luggage form” to initiate a search etc. There is seem to be a loophole in the system and I subsequently found out that a small case of jewelry was left and never found/returned to a South African traveler under similar circumstances, I could deal with shabby toilets on board, continuous 4 resets of the entertainment system and other nonsense hardly compatible with a business class level of service claimed by the Ethiopian Airline, however this case of dodgy disappearance of personal property with zero subsequent response would prevent me from flying them ever again.

The issues consisted of actions of the commands without doing anything on the touch screen or on the remote, and in another flight of not having any sound.

Aug,2023.0,"A few merits, but airline to handle with care",London,Lagos International,"This airline, using the hub of Addis Ababa, offers convenient flights. We wrote a good review a few years ago, highlighting the surprisingly good service and smooth running. On a round-trip flight, we had to go through a few mishaps, which were not always handled as well as they could have been: - invitation to pay, quite a lot, for specific seats: we were not tempted - overbooking; passengers were not told anything but to go and sit down; when enquiring about the situation, information was hard to come by while other passengers boarded the plane in our plain view (frustrating); stranded passengers started to worry if they will be admitted on the flight, when or if they could reach their destination, etc.; it turned out to be much ado about nothing, as seats became available; a little bit of timely communication would have helped - a passenger having health issues; it was handled with empathy and care, but it resulted in countless cabin crew around him, in quite a disorganised way; some mild-crisis management training could help the airline - rebooking a flight led us to an office headed by a prison-wardour-style manager, ready to scold passengers who dared ask for a rebooking; the operative was more professional, but too keen to sell upgrades to business class, and then found that cancellations just happened, by coincidence, this very minute, hence economy class 'became' available after the customer asked to try harder Let us add to this blandand tasteless food, limited entertainment, badly designed and uselessly repetitive safety video, numerous reports of lost luggage, hasty half-checking of visas (responsibility of the airline) as points for necessary improvements. We also noted that the staff seems exclusively Ethiopian, hence a few worries that the airline may recruit the most appropriate people for the jobs. In spite of the reservations above, we still think that this airline has a few merits, and offers a convenient way to fly for their part of the world.",2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Between Manchester and Geneva we were served a cold meal of smoked salmon. From Geneva to Addis there was a choice of 4 main courses and we chose the fillet steak which was excellent. Champagne was available while on the ground and there was a good choice of other alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The entertainment channels were adequate but I had downloaded some Netflix films to watch. The seats turn into full beds and I managed a few hours sleep. The lounge at Addis is excellent and I had a shower and changed my clothes. The flight from Addis to Cape Town had six seats across and they served both Ethiopian and western food.

Aug,2023.0,Worst airline I've ever flown with.,Addis Ababa,London International,"We had traveled from Zanzibar to Addis Ababa for our connecting flight to Heathrow. We had a 4.5-hour wait which was reasonably ok after we had gone through security, however, the Burger King there was really overpriced ($20/ abt £18 for a basic meal and it wasn't even that nice) But the worse was yet to come. We knew that on the flight we would only get water in tiny cups and would have to wait ages after take off for it so bought bottles of water to take on with us. We had NOT left the airport and the bottles were bought in a departure lounge shop. Plus the bottles were STILL sealed, yet we were not allowed to take them through the gate onto the plane!! How backward is that? I have flown with several other airlines recently and have been allowed to take liquids bought at the airport onto the plane. On our flight from Zanzibar, my daughter had felt very faint from heat and dehydration and we had to wait for about half an hour before the stewardess bought her water so we hadn't wanted to go through that again. The stewardesses weren't very friendly either and they were doing just the bare minimum without any enthusiasm (in economy anyway) The food was unappetizing and the announcements drove us mad, they were soooooo loud through the headphones, and why show the safety video showing how to use the seat belts once the plane is on the runway and not before that. It is irrelevant then. Plus showing it twice to incorporate English. Just show it once with English subtitles underneath.

So it probably explains the vote when you see cabin crew do nothing to address excess drinking - they must be the voters. Notwithstanding that, the rules are the same for the other airlines, so what must they be like!! Invariably, the cabin crew are sullen, and why do they insist on waking you up for what can only be described as inedible food - someone at Ethiopian thinks that a flavourless chicken casseroly type thing with rice deserves a plain rice starter, and what makes it worse is that his/her bosses think the same (the same person clearly still has had his/her job for the last 5 years). Although the planes are new and reasonably comfortable (someone needs to tell Airbus to take the light/call switches off just where your elbow lands on the armrest) I can fly Ethiopian no longer.

Sep,2023.0,The most racist airline,Entebbe,London International,"I have never seen such racist airline. I was denied boarding my flight for no reason other than holding Eritrean passport. Some other African countries passport holders, such as from Nigeria and even from the UK (Eritreans having UK travel documents) were also denied boarding in the first instances. But, they couldn’t dare to hold back much longer to the Eritreans with UK TRAVEL documents. To be clear, we are not saying UK passport, but refugee travel document. Whereas for me, with Eritrean passport, they kept denying me, in saying they don’t believe I can get a visa from the Embassy of the UK, when clearly I got a sticker of a visa in my passport that allows me to travel to the Uk. They scanned the visa and the biometric information of my passport around 10 time, three supervisors, in the terminal. They couldn’t get anything, but insisted they can’t let me board, and made me to wait one hour and thirty minute-yet even though they couldn’t get anything to be suspicious in my visa and passport. Finally, they asked me, if I have evidence of email exchanges from the embassy of UK, which I replied, yeah. They asked to show them, and I happily accept their request, and start to scroll in my email contacts, after two seconds of scrolling, they didn’t even bother to see the emails they asked for; just my willingness and eagerness to scroll through my emails made them satisfied, and told me I can go. I said, but you didn’t even see the emails you guys requested. They said, no it’s fine just go. I asked, why did they specifically stopped me from boarding, even after they made ten time or so scanning my documents through their machines, and nothing wrong came up with it, and yet refused to believe I have the right to board that flight. I also asked, why didn’t they do the same to the other Eritreans but with UK documents? One of the supervisor said, we do what we want to do, you can’t tell us how we do our job. After that point, it felt I am speaking to brick of walls, and I was just wasting my time and energy to even get an answer, and boarded as the last passenger. The door literally closed after I entered. The saddest part is, the treatment you get is based on what passport you hold. It’s such a shameful discriminatory act, and nerve wrecking at the same time. But, that was nothing. What is even worse and was devastating is, they insist I speak Amharic (the Ethiopian language). I wish I could speak their language, which could had been a plus for me, but, unfortunately, I can’t speak their language as I am an Eritrean. I can only speak English, and my mother tongue language that is Tigrigna. But these people had the audacity to say, how come you don’t speak Amharic language, if you are Eritrean? I told them, because I am Eritrean; and in Eritrea we don’t speak Amharic, we speak Tigrigna. I asked, how in the world would they expect me to speak a language I don’t normally use it on a daily basis? But, they shrugged off my question, andcontinued in their mindset of their denial accepting I can board on that flight with Eritrean passport and flying to London. It’s such a bizarre and unforgivable experience; and I have vowed and promised with myself to never ever use the Ethiopian airlines ever after, for good after that degrading mistreatment incident. We are not talking about why they did a thorough check on me and my visa, that is not even the point, that’s fine; but after proving again and again, again and again a person has a valid visa, and after their passport have been scanned again and again to a number of two digits, you still deny them boarding their flight, only because you can’t believe they can get a legit visa to board to London, and only because they are Eritrean passport holders?! Man, that’s another level messed up mindset and utterly racist. Even worse, insisting someone should speak your language or know your language, because they look like you, when repeatedly they told you, they are citizens of another country, and you keep insisting talking to them with “Amharic language”, when they are willing to engage with you in English? This is another level of messed up bigotry racist mind. Anyways, this incident is the last time I will ever use Ethiopian airlines. Regards Mehari",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

This said, Ethiopian Airlines is by far the most irresponsible, disorganized, and evil (deliberately malicious) airline there is of those I tried, and I fly frequently. Their airplanes are in poor condition, they introduce new processes that they themselves do not know how to follow (so be ready to get stranded in the middle of nowhere if you are flying with a layover!), they delay flights and luggage, and luggage can be delayed by as much as 5 days (10 days in a friend's case). The airline employees ignore you if they can (are not in the office when they should be, do not answer emails, do not answer the phone, do not reply when you fill out the airline's online contact form), and if they cannot ignore you anymore, they lie. During my last flight, I was lied to more than a dozen times about whether my luggage was actually loaded on a plane (it was not 5 out of 6 times) and when it would be arriving. For five days straight the airline representatives, including managers, reassured me that the luggage would be arriving the next day, and that it was already loaded and was arriving that day (!), but those were lies except on the last day. Why even lie that luggage was loaded when you know it was not?!

Oct,2023.0,offered zero customer service,Addis Ababa,Cape Town,"We had two flights with Ethiopian Airways, 1. O’Hare to Addis Ababa and 2. Addis Ababa to Cape Town. Both flights we had a horrible experience. For the first flight the two of us initially purchased economy tickets but then upgraded to business class online for both passengers. At the check-in desk at O’Hare the workers informed us that 2 upgrades were placed under one name. They accused us of doing this and said our only options were for one of us to sit in economy or to pay the airport upgrade price, which was $500 more that what we paid for the online upgrade. After 20 minutes of arguing and speaking with a woman who identified herself as a supervisor, we surrendered and paid the airport upgrade fee so we did not miss our flight. Eventually I called and emailed Ethiopian Airlines and was refunded this. Why should customers have to fight for something we booked accurately AND paid for already? The online system couldn't have allowed me to do two upgrades on one person for one flight. It just is not possible. The second flight was the most jaw dropping events.....On 10/12 the plane flew from Cape Town from Addis Ababa relatively on time at around 1440. The captain announced overhead that we could not land because an aircraft on the runway had compromised the our ability to land (fuel or hydraulic fluid issue, which I learned several days later on my own). We flew around in circles for 45 minutes over Cape Town waiting for the runway to be cleared. The captain announced we would be landing in Cape Town shortly, workers were simply inspecting the runway to make sure conditions were optimal. Five minutes passed since the announcement and I noticed on the inflight 3D maps that the flight was rerouted heading north to Johannesburg. The captain did not inform us of this plan until 10 minutes after we were in route. How is this acceptable? What was supposed to be a 6 hour flight turned into TWO days of uncertainty, stress, no accommodations by Ethiopian Airways, and no guidance. Unexpected delays included; 45 minutes flying around Cape Town in attempts to land, a 120 minute unexpected flight to Johannesburg, 2.5hrs waiting on the plane in Johannesburg for a solution only to be told we needed to disembark, hours waiting to check into a hotel that was arranged by myself, TWO unplanned hotel nights in Johannesburg that were not compensated for, and a flight on 10/14 purchased by myself. Although this runway closure is not Ethiopian’s fault, the communication by Ethiopian was despicable. The were no instructions (hotel and future flight) or compensation given or even discussed. We were told we would be contacted via telephone for a future flight arrangement; however, two days later we heard nothing.

Oct,2023.0,Worst Airline Ever,Durban,Dubai International,"Ive always booked with Ethiopian Airlines because of their cheap prices. In recent years, their fares have increased to roughly the same as Emirates and the other top end airlines, thereby defeating the purpose of travelling with Ethiopian Airlines. My father was ill and we were forced to rebook our ticket. We paid the additional fees, which costed us $100 less than a new flight only to cancel plans due to medical issues. When i called in, I was told that they wont charge me fees because i already paid it. Upon rebooking, i was met with those fees again, ontop of the increased fare, costing me the same as another flight. All in all, I couldve done 3 trips for the price of 1. All this to travel on one of the worst airlines on Earth. I spent hours with them on the phone, with multiple agents, only to be told that i cannot get a refund, even if i pay their fees. We are working class people and this is hard earned money which has been stripped away. We cannot travel this year because of this ordeal, nor have we been able to since 2019 due to Covid. The airline has poor facilities like you would expect. Toilets are never cleaned so urine is always all over the floor. Food is worthless and they constantly get our meal selections incorrect or give our meals away to other passengers. The overall state of the plane is very run down with entertainment screens not working, broken armrests/tray tables and dirty/uncomfortable seats. Staff is generally rude and the airport is one of the worst ive been to. This will be the last flight I take with Ethiopian.

We had very questionable descends and on our landing at Johannesburg, I could feel we came in too fast and uncontrolled. Upon landing the plane bounced in the air after it made impact with the landing strip, and then lost control left to right.

We were stuck on runway for 5 hours on Oct 12th (becuase of hyd leak on only runway at cape town airport - which was no fault of Ethiopian Airlines). The way Ethiopian Airlines handled this situation was poor with no communication the whole 5 hrs we were stuck on airplane. The crew lost control of passengers and it was complete chaos !! finally went back to terminal after canceling the flight but then again we were left on our own to find hotels, transportation , etc. when I got to my hotel, I opened my bag only to find out that someone had stolen all gifts i had in there for my family back in US. They basically left open boxes but took all contents. I took pictures and complained next day to Ethiopian Airline customer service at airport but they did not care of show any sympathy of compassion. I called my travel agent and booked flight out of there on British Airways and lost my funds with Ethiopian Airlines. I emailed personnel at ET Airlines several times with pictures showing inside of my bag with open boxes and so far no response. I travel 50% of every month and i have to say that Ethiopian Airlines is the worst airlines I ever flown on and will never fly on again or let any of my family or friends fly on either. do yourselves a favor and find other airlines to get to your destinations.

Oct,2023.0,"LEFT ABANDONED. NO COMMUNICATION, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE",Addis Ababa,Cape Town Central Africa,"We had two flights with Ethiopian airways; 1. Ohare to Addis Ababa & 2. Addis Ababa to Cape town. Both flights we had a horrible experience. For the first flight the two of us initially purchased economy tickets but then upgraded to business class online for both passengers. At the check-in desk at Ohare the workers informed us that 2 upgrades were placed under one name. They accused us of doing this and said our only options were for one of us to sit in economy or to pay the airport upgrade price, which was $500 more that what we paid for the online upgrade. After 20 minutes of arguing and speaking with a woman who identified herself as a supervisor, we surrendered and paid the airport upgrade fee so we did not miss our flight. Eventually I called and emailed Ethician airlines and was refunded this. Why should customers have to fight for something we booked accurately AND paid for already? The online system couldn't have allowed me to do two upgrades on one person for one flight. It just is not possible. The second flight was the most jaw dropping events.....On 10/12 the plane flew from Cape Town from Addis Ababa relatively on time at around 1440. The captain announced overhead that we could not land because an aircraft on the runway had compromised the our ability to land (fuel or hydraulic fluid issue, which I learned several days later on my own). We flew around in circles for 45 minutes over Cape Town waiting for the runway to be cleared. The captain announced we would be landing in Cape Town shortly, workers were simply inspecting the runway to make sure conditions were optimal. Five minutes passed since the announcement and I noticed on the inflight 3D maps that the flight was rerouted heading north to Johannesburg. The captain did not inform us of this plan until 10 minutes after we were in route. How is this acceptable? What was suppose to be a 6 hour flight turned into TWO days of uncertainty, stress, no accommodations by Ethiopian airways, and no guidance. Unexpected delays included; 45 minutes flying around Cape Town in attempts to land, a 120 minute unexpected flight to Johannesburg, 2.5hrs waiting on the plane in Johannesburg for a solution only to be told we needed to disembark, hours waiting to check into a hotel that was arranged by myself, TWO unplanned hotel nights in Johannesburg that were not compensated for, and a flight on 10/14 purchased by myself. Although this runway closure is not Ethiopian airline’s fault, the communication by Ethiopian airway was despicable. The were no instructions (hotel and future flight) or compensation given or even discussed. We were told we would be contacted via telephone for a future flight arrangement; however, two days later we heard nothing. In attempts to receive a departure flight out of Johannesburg, I called the customer service number 3 times; the evening of 10/12, the morning of 10/13, and the afternoon 10/13. On the morning of 10/13, I learned that the runway at CPT was open since it was noted on their social media. All customer service representatives said they had no information and we would be contacted. I gave up and purchased a flight to Cape Town with another airline. To this day and time we have not been contacted about a flight out of Johannesburg. Furthermore, while waiting on the plane for 2.5hrs in Johannesburg, the crew was far from apologetic and offered zero customer service. The flight attendants stood around in their kitchenette and laid out beverages for self-serve which were trampled by multiple customers. The bathroom cleanliness was no longer monitored or maintained, they looked disheveled. Complementary Wi-Fi was not offered. This would have be a way of customer appreciation so we could inform our car rental and lodging reservation of a late arrival. How do you leave customers without basics amenities for all this time? I have contacted customer service via email about these issues only to hear an automated response. It's unfortunate how a business can run like this.

Told me I would have more leg room and no one next to me. Get on the plan to discover their only two seat in this row and the dude is definitely right next me.

The in-flight device was sub-par and no wi-fi. We had a roundtrip from Atlanta to Lusaka and during my stay I had a death in my immediate family and had to change my departure date to attend the funeral. We went to Ethiopian Airlines office in Lusaka and they were very cold and lacked customer service. We waited for hours to speak with someone and it felt like they were deliberately ignoring us. After hours of waiting they asked for a death certificate and mind you thats not produced on the same day a person passes away. We returned at a later date with documentation and they refused to change my departure date and they informed me a change in date was impossible and if I missed my flight I would have to pay for a new ticket at full price so I ended up paying for another ticket at full price to stay for bereavement. Ethiopian staff were not empathetic and did not take into consideration that my initial ticket was already expense. On the flights the flight crew spoke in their native language and ignored everyone that did not speak their language. It was obvious they were not happy to service the passengers and only smiled when they spoke with their fellow Ethiopians.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality
Dec,2023.0,its a pretty decent product,Stockholm,Zanzibar,"Family of 6 flying to Zanzibar for holiday. Ethiopian are (currently) our airline of choice for flying out of Stockholm to Africa. They have a daily overnight flight to Addis Ababa leaving at 9:50pm connecting with the rest of Africa which means that unlike the ME carriers you do not waste time flying too far east only to fly back. As three of our party of Star Alliance Gold we can bring the whole family to the lounges for free at all three points (Arlanda (7/10), Addis Ababa (5/10) and Zanzibar (3/10). We checked in at Star Alliance Gold and also managed to get advance boarding. This will all change for the worse when SAS leaves Star Alliance and goes for Flying Blue. Their App is well designed, clear, but maybe a tad slow to load but is probably most useful for retention of boarding passes. I recommend both their web based booking engine and check-in process. Biggest plus was on booking we were permitted to reserve all seats for the four legs on a basic economy ticket. This is a game changer when travelling in Africa (and Arlanda) when the differences of deplaning from as few as 10 rows can results in an hour difference in the queues for immigration. As for the flight its a pretty decent product. The aircraft are not the most modern. The FA service was professional including free unlimited drinks service and full food even on a 2.5 hour leg.

Dec,2023.0,Ambivalence about this airline,Singapore,Sao Paulo International,"This is quite a strange airline. On the one hand, the four sectors I took (round trip) were all on time and went smoothly; on the other hand, there were little details that caused me concern/annoyance/ambivalence. First the good: the airline connects people in the Global South and made for very speedy journeys bypassing hubs in North America and Europe. For trips across the southern hemisphere or along the equator, there are some very good connections (e.g. Asia to South America). My flights were all on time on landing, and my luggage was delivered accurately despite the fifth freedom stops (although my suitcase was squashed out of shape on one side after the first flight). For my journeys between ADD and GRU and vv., the A350s were new, modern with good IFE. I thoroughly enjoyed these Airbus flights. Now the iffy: I didn't like the 'old' B787s that ET uses. By old, I mean that some can be about 10 years old. Although not deployed on my flights, ET also procured quite a few of the ""terrible teens"" - the 787 prototypes that had to be re-engineered to iron out some structural issues. The 787s that I sat on were not clean. They were dark and not well lit, and the windows were always blacked out. One didn't have a functioning flight map at all - so we all didn't know where we were. Beyond equipment, service was inconsistent, even lacklustre on the outbound. FAs can be quite rude, and they have no qualms bumping you in the knee with their carts. Food was not good - lots of carbs and uninspiring; options ran out. I had a ""chicken"" meal and it turned out to be a bed of fried rice, with a single half chicken sausage. The toilets were not kept clean, and reeked of urine even on boarding. Transit was okay only because I had lounge access. The airport was otherwise crowded and chaotic. During the security check for transits in ADD, only one body scanner was in use, and it took ages to process everyone from one flight. On the outbound transit, there was a black out in the airport. ET506/507 can suffer from major delays because of the distance. ADD being a high altitude airport has MTOW restrictions. If the winds are too strong, the service does an additional stop in EBB Uganda, causing two hour delays. This however did not happen to my flights. We boarded one aircraft at a remote bay, with the engine cowlings open. Pretty unusual. The aircraft was delayed by 40 min but made up time to arrive on time. Would I recommend ET? Yes and no. On the one hand, everything went smoothly. The airline did its job of transporting. On the other hand, there were just so many things that would raise an eyebrow, that I am not sure where to put my finger on this airline.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Dec,2023.0,8 hour Delay!,Riyadh,Johannesburg International,"I had the worst experience flying Ethiopian Airlines. ET 413; RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA (RUH) - Johannesburg OR Tambo -12/Dec/2023 3:40am flight. – KMQIRA - 0712140570978 On take off there was a sickly child travelling with father only. As much as I commend the flight attendants for heeding the call to assist but the situation could have been handled more efficiently. The infant (7 months) was in distress and needed medical attention. Instead of calling ambulance to take father and son, off the plane to get required help, the entire plane was waiting on tarmac for 2 hours while the infant was attended to. What does your protocol say in these circumstances? Better decision could have been taken as half the flight had connecting transfers in Ethiopia. Needless to say, no communication was made to the colleagues for our connecting flights at Addis Ababa. We were left to find our own means - running to terminals where to our dismay our flights had left us. We were then referred to customer support who were least bothered at having approximately 30 people inconvenienced. I was told the next flight is 6 hours later! When I would have been in Johannesburg already. I had to request accommodations/ provisions to be provided to me in this waiting period - which was given begrudgingly in the lowest (silver?) lounge. The next flight also left an hour later than scheduled, proving that the earlier flights could have waited for us. I had hoped this was the last of my ordeal. My luggage was then misplaced meaning I could not leave Johannesburg to make the 5 hour trip in SA to my rural home. Yet again I was inconvenienced by Ethiopian airlines as I had to wait for the next incoming flights to deliver the bag which came the following evening. Taking my schedule out by a day and a half. I almost missed my function and without clothes and hair etc. because of the inefficiencies of the Airline/ staff. It was my first journey with Ethiopian airlines but it truly left a bitter taste in our mouths - the anxiety I had to go through at a time when I was meant to be my happiest going home etc. I would recommend that you review and provide training to staff when such incidents occur.",1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Upon landing I find out my luggage has not arrived. I waited at the airport for 3 hours after that searching for my bags to no avail. I had not had a change of clothes since the 22nd of December and had to purchase clothing, toiletries and medication. I eventually contacted the airport on Christmas morning and informed me that my luggage arrived. I collected it immediately. Ethiopian airlines actually only emailed me on the 26th of December to tell me that my luggage has arrived. Their staff are very incompetent, no one at the airport seemed to know anything. I called the global call center three times, and all three representatives gave me different and conflicting information.

I was able to reserve our seats via the app without paying extra. Check-in at Sydney International was a bit of a issue but that was due to the Ethiopia staff member (not the check-in staff) confusing everyone as to where the Ethiopia Airline line actually was. Interestingly, the check-in at Cape Town International was far smoother than at Sydney. Luggage was booked all the way through to Cape Town (and visa versa on return). No issues whatsoever.

Dec,2023.0,SONYA - Manager at Ethiopian Airways Bulawayo is HORRIBLE person,Bulawayo,Bristol International,"Everyone from the flight and offices was totally amazing except one woman MANAGER of BULAWAYO BRANCH whose name is SONYA. This SONYA woman is VERY RUDE with a VERY BAD ATTITUDE!!! When I arrived at Heathrow I could not find ET1109 which was listed as a flight connecting me to Bristol. I could not find any of my bags and the counters that deal with lost bags told me that the bags will be delivered at my expense. Here I am with 3 children who are coming to the UK for the first time meaning their everything is in the bags and it's full on winter in the UK. So I called Ethiopian airlines Bulawayo whatsapp number and spoke to this SONYA woman and explained my difficult situation. For starters she tells me to go to Ethiopian offices at Heathrow which is none existent. I explained to her which offices attends to these grievances. I also explained that with the way things are going I won't catch my 10:30 connection which they are also saying is non existent. She told me that I'm using a bus NATIONAL EXPRESS. So I called National express and they did not have my name on their 10:30 bus so they asked for my bus ticket number which I did not have. I called SONYA to send me my bus ticket number and she said she will email. I never saw the email and phoned again to let her know that nothing has come in from emails. I then requested that she sends just the ticket number to my whatsapp immediately and she never did. From then on she ignored my calls and I had to pay afresh 4 tickets from Heathrow to Bristol. MONEY WASTED, TIME WASTED, CHILDREN SUFFERED, DISCOMFORT WAITIMG AROUND THE AIRPORT FOR 5 HOURS SEARCHING FOR BAGS. I then called her 2 weeks later to give her my grievance and she responded that... 1) It wasn't her fault that I missed my bus coz she told me to go the bags will follow and the man at the counter was adamant that I will have to pay for the delivery of my bags. I even asked SONYA to hold the line and hear the man speaking or at least talk to him but she dropped the line. 2) She told me that EVERYONE knows that there is no flight to Bristol and I could not understand the EVERYONE KNOWS part as I was using this flight for the first time and Bristol connection was listed as a flight. 3) She said there is nothing she can do as everything is my fault and she was soo ready to drop the call. ONLY TODAY SHE TELKS ME THAT ET1109 IS THE BUS I WAS SUPPOSED TO USE WHICH IM NOT SURE EXISTS BUT ON THE DAY I WAS TRAVELLING SHE CLEARLY SAID IT IS NATIONAL EXPRESS WHICH I CALLED AND DID NOT HAVE MY NAME ON THEIR 10:30 BUS.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Dec,2023.0,Never again - only good thing is the layover hotel,London,Harare International,"I have mixed feelings about this airline and the 2 flights me & my son took from Gatwick to Ethiopia and then to Zimbabwe. Our flight was at 10:10am from Gatwick, we were not able to check in online, we got to Gatwick at 7:30am the queue were so long, we did not get to check I until 9:45am. We got our boarding passes and went to the security gate only to be told they can not let us on, we explained we had been there from 7:30am only getting our boarding passes now they said Ethiopian airlines always does this, we would need to go back to the checkin desk and get a representative of the airline to confirm that we can go through security and board. They did that, I requested airport assistance as my son had a fractured ankle I was told because they are so late checking everyone in they can not provide airport assistance. I managed to find a wheelchair, they sent me to the wrong boarding gate, I realised it was incorrect so had to run back to find the correct one, fell over with my son in the wheelchair. We was in a state by the time we got to the gate. The plane was old and broken, the seats with controls to call staff and lights etc was broken and I tripped when I went to the back of the plane to get water as the floor boards where up. The air hostess asked if they can connect to my hotspot, I was shocked. The flight, no matter how long you put on the light to calm for assistance no one is coming. Toilets are very dirty. Aisle and chair space is narrow. Meals forget it, I not airlines meals are not nice but this one I had to laugh, I asked for vegetarian it was plain dry, white paste.i quickly changed to fish. The 2 starts is for the layover skyline hotel that was nice. The second flight we took from Ethiopian to Zimbabwe was much better, service was on point and air hostess were very attentive. The landing OMG no one can tell me there is not a God, the plane came in so fast that hit with such force it shock violently until the plane came to a stop. First and most definitely the last time that will be flying with Ethiopian airways.

Check in at Capetown was chaotic, two flights being checked in together with Staff confusing everyone.

Airline is brilliant, nice clean planes, good leg room, cabin crew not excessively smiley or friendly but efficient. Generous baggage allowance, 2x23kg. Airport is chaotic but helpful staff dotted around to point you in the right direction. Ethiopian Airlines app and website are both pretty useless but luckily it's easy to get hold of a human via telephone. Issue I had initially was that I wanted to take a bike and the info on the website was of course of absolutely no help whatsoever. Customer service tried to be helpful but they also couldn't make sense of the rules and I was eventually transferred to the Addis Ababa HQ but they gave me the wrong information. So just putting this here for anyone wanting to take a bike on Ethiopian Airlines: as long as your bike box is within the weight allowance of 23kg then it doesn't cost extra. Unfortunately the bike (and my suitcase) got left behind in Addis Ababa but both arrived the next day. I don't believe this is the airlines fault but the airport's.",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,TripAdvisor

Jan,2024.0,told we cannot board our flight,Hong Kong,Cape Town,"Autistic son and I were told we cannot board our flight. On 31 January 2024, my son and I were travelling from Nanjing to Cape Town. Coincidentally, it was also 04th birthday and we were blissfully excited about our journey. Unfortunately, the experience soon turned into what could be described as a nightmare. As I had not opted to check in my luggage, Ethiopian Airlines had already emailed the boarding passes for my son and me. So upon arrival in Hong Kong, we were asked for the boarding passes and allowed to enter Terminal 1, go through all the checks and searches and eventually arrive early at the Ethiopian Airline boarding gate. I approached the counter and spoke with a male representative (I’ll call him Kay). He informed me that I was meant to collect my luggage and check in before entering Terminal 1 etc. He spoke kindly and said that although I wouldn’t be able to get the luggage at that point, I could continue my journey to South Africa and on arrival at Cape Town International Airport, I would need to go to the baggage claim office, explain the situation that the baggage was not collected in Hong Kong, show them my baggage passes and ask them to write a report which would be sent to Hong Kong airport and then arrangements could be made to have the luggage sent to Cape Town. I was very grateful that this employee was solution-driven and offered such kind service that would not impact me severely as a customer. He then printed our boarding passes and asked me to have a seat. About 30 minutes later, passengers were boarding the plane and my son and I stood up. Again, the male representative who had spoken with me earlier said that I should have a seat, which we did. This was the last time I engaged with this representative. After there were only a few passengers left we went to wait in line. During this time, I witnessed two other passengers who had flown from the USA with United Airlines, whose luggage had not been accounted for. They were asked to stay behind, as I was, but they were soon allowed to board the flight. When my son and I got to the front, we were told that there was a problem, but the airline representatives could not tell me what the problem was. At this point, my son was stimming, as those with ASD sometimes do in stressful situations. He was sitting on the floor repeating letters of the alphabet and opposite words. A different male representative (I’ll call him Ray), then stood staring at my son. I explained to him that my son is autistic and that he sometimes stims in that way, but not to worry as he would soon stop. The same representative who was staring said nothing in response and continued to stare. After some minutes, this person then approached me with our boarding passes in hand and said that it was not the airline’s problem that our luggage was not collected and that unfortunately we would not be allowed to board the flight. At first, I thought he was joking, because he had a smirk on his face and his tone was condescending. He said that I would need to cancel the flight with the agent and see if I could rebook the flight. I told him that I didn’t fully understand the reason and asked if he could explain this. He then asked for a moment and walked away without offering any explanation or customer-centred behaviour. He was cold and unwilling to even speak to my husband who was on the phone with me at the time trying to help me.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality

I go to the airport CPT and they say it will be confirmed when I arrive in ADD. I arrive in ADD and they tell me my booking is confirmed but I will get my boarding pass at the gate and I have to wait in the airport for 7.10 hours. I told the officer please if my ticket is not confirmed then I can take the next day flight and get an hotel, he said no you are on this flight. 6 hrs later I go to the gate at 4 am (departure at 5.15am) and the woman at the gate A8 was the least helpful and very rude person, she refused to call interline and told me I am not on this flight and go sort it myself. I spoke to Egyptair and he told me its not my problem it is Ethiopian Airlines mess to sort out.

Feb,2024.0,"Good Food, Worse International Transfer",Zurich,Cape Town Central International,"It was my third time flying to Cape Town, South Africa from Zürich, Switzerland, and making an adventure out of each journey, I always fly with different airlines. First it was Qatar Airways via Doha, then it was Lufthansa via Frankfurt, Germany and my most recent was with Ethiopian Airline via Milan, Italy and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Of all three airlines, I must give Best Airline Food to Ethiopia Airlines, but that’s about it really; everything else is below mark. Here are the details: My outbound flight on February 11, 2024 was on ET 737, an A350-900. Taxiing, take-off and landing to Addis Ababa via Milan was smooth every time, the pilot or pilots were informative, although I found it strange that every announcement was aired by a different person; the cockpit must have been crowded. Cabin staff were children, in my opinion, far from professional, with noticeable laughs and giggles among themselves as they held a private birthday party. And despite water leaking out of the lavatory, none of them seemed bothered by it; oh well, eventually the cabin air dried it up. Aside from that, they served the passengers as expected; I had chicken, which was with rice and sliced carrots, a bread roll, butter, cous-cous mixed with carrots and green peas, crackers, cheese and salted sticky toffee pudding. Hands down, it was the best food I have ever tasted onboard a non-private aircraft. “9 out of 10, for food, Ethiopian Airlines!” The nightmare started at Addis Ababa’s International Transfer Security checkpoint; it was madness and mayhem. Understaffed! Approximately 400 transferring passengers to maybe 8 staff; passengers were cutting lines, running around, bags weren’t being scanned properly or at all. It was the worse that I have ever witnessed, not to mention how dirty and cluttered it was with grey trays all over the floor; none the less, I managed to get out and catch my connecting flight to Cape Town on ET 847, a B 787-8/9, where the annoyance continued with Ethiopian Airlines changing my seat number 11, which I paid extra for, to some cheap seat in the 30th row next to the lavatory. A prompt complaint was made along with a refund request. That outcome is still pending. The entire staff on ET 847 from ADD to CPT were of a different batch, they ran a more professional shift. Special Acknowledgement to the hostess with “Merawith” on her name tag. Again, the food was good. Returning on February 25, 2024 from CPT to ADD, on ET 846, a B 787-8/9, everything went smooth and professional, including my allotted paid seat. Again, the food was good. And again, the International Transfer at Addis Ababa Airport was chaotic and out of order; I have never seen anything like it anywhere. Something ought to be done about that. Still, I managed to clear that hell of an experience and reach my connecting flight, ET 736, an A350-900, which was fine considering that I was given the seat that I paid for. The plane was not clean, it was noticeable on the dining trays which had leftover food and stains from previous passengers.. But the Cabin Crew were friendly and assisting. Kudos to one of the stewardesses, who assisted the woman next to me with her infant child as she brought the necessary seatbelt extensions and affixed a bassinet to wall; it was clear, by her handling of the child, that she had training and paid attention. We landed in Milan, Italy for some of the passengers to disembark and the aircraft to be refuelled. While waiting, I did notice that one of the Cabin Crew had to become verbally stern with a few passengers, but rightly so, as they had ignored her several times when she asked politely for them to remain seated during the refuelling procedure. A spray was used to doused the entire cabin before the aircraft took off for Zurich, I can’t say that I am a fan of that as it affects my allergies. Upon enquiring, I was told that it was bug spray. I understand the necessity, but knowing that some level of toxicity is in the air, made me uncomfortable. We left Milan after an hour, and just when I thought that there’d be no more incidents to note, one of my checked baggage was sliced open with what appeared to have been a bladed tool; “Thank, Ethiopia Airline!”",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

This last trip I had with them will be the last time I fly with them. On the second leg of my return trip, from Addis Ababa to Manchester, the customer service was absolutely rotted. There was a final security check right at the gate where I was boarding. I walked through the scanner and something went off so they wanted to pat me down. This security woman comes up to me and barks “male or female??” in a very rude tone. Like she could not tell whether I’m a man or a woman and then she makes that lack of sense my problem? I honestly just stared at her and said “what?”, to which she responds nothing and proceeds to pat me down. It was just rude and gross. Then, they took a brand new bottle of water I had just purchased at the airport off me, which has never happened to me on any other flight - once you’ve gone through main security it’s standard to be able to take a new water bottle on the plane. On top of that, as I was drinking the water then and there so as not to waste it, one male staff member kept making odd creepy faces at me saying “drink, drink!” Like maybe it was good natured but this is at 3 am in the morning and clearly not the time for this kind of “humour”, it just made me feel harassed and creeped out. They also took a bottle of rum I had bought in entebbe airport off me - even though it was fully wrapped up and marked as duty free, they said they had to take it and check it in with the luggage. They put some bubble wrap around it, but of course, when I arrived at Manchester airport and went to get my luggage, it had been smashed. Maybe this airline doesn’t care to lose customers, especially ones only flying economy, but they should be careful how far they push it.

On the day of departure: checked in, checked various facts, paid 370 euros for the dog's ticket (rate only for one route), passed immigration and after almost an hour of being in the boarding area an employee came looking for me and informed me in advance. that they can't take my dog on board due to a ""problem"" in the hold. Sorry which was confirmed to me by the Ethiopian staff. I reply that it shouldn't be my problem given how far in advance I booked, asking for a quick solution that didn't involve traveling on separate aircraft. They replied ""I'll go and ask the captain"" who obviously refused, saying that the plane was small and it wasn't possible to accommodate him in the cabin (23 kg including the cage). Surprise surprise so many empty seats but for my dog there was no way. So I had to leave her in Zanzibar. The icing on the cake could not be missed with this company. They pass by for the meal and ask: chicken or beef. I ask for vegetables and the pissed off hostess hands me the tray. The photo of the container speaks for itself. Blood? Rust? Dirty?

Mar,2024.0,Ethiopian Airlines - Misrepresentation of Travel Routes with intent to deceive,Johannesburg,Milan International,"Very disappointed in our experience with Ethiopian Airlines to date!!! The airline was recommended by a friend and we were looking forward to flying with them, to Italy in April 2024 for a family skiing holiday. From what we can see they seem to have a bad, misleading & fraudulent business practice of selling flights based on one set of parameters and then altering their schedule to suit their own specific economic benefits once they have drawn their customer in and received payment. Impacting their customers travel plans and resultant travel related expenditure. Their online website and associated travel agents are currently still marketing and selling the following non-stop flights from Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) to Italy. The none non-stop flight marketed from Addis Ababa to Milan departs at 00:15am and arrives in Milan Malpensa (MXP) airport at 5:50am the same morning. Another non-stop flight is marketed from Addis Ababa (ADD) to Rome departs at 00:05am and arrives in Rome Fiumicino (FCO) at 05:35am the same morning. Both direct flights taking around 6:30 hours to complete. Once booked and paid, about a month later, we received notification of a ""schedule change"" which now moves us from the non-stop flight to Milan to a new flight via Rome. This will result in us having to stop in Rome on route with a considerable time difference, to when we were scheduled to arrive in Milan according to the original itinerary that we transacted on with the airline and their agent. Our whole itinerary has now had to now be changed at great cost and inconvenience to ourselves. We will have to try and rebook the prepaid train/taxi transfers and forfeit ski-hire, ski pass and a planned afternoons skiing with friends and family at our expense.This practice pays no regard to inconveniences/expenditure caused to their customers. This would not have happened if Ethiopian Airlines just was upfront with us/travel agents when we booked the original ticket in February 2024. I am battling to see what they are trying to achieve by promising customers direct flight into Milan from Addis Ababa and then systematically changing these parameters once the ticket have been booked and paid for. In conducting a subsequent google search it tells me that Ethiopian Airlines only has one direct non-stop flight into Rome currently and there is not in fact a direct non-stop flight to Milan. But their website and associated travel agents websites are currently selling non-stop direct flights into Milan from Addis Ababa. I tried to query this with their call centre/helpline and they were of absolutely no assistance. Stonewalling the process and suggesting that if I didn't like the schedule changes of arrival that I could rebook if the new times did not suit us. At additional cost and inconvenience to ourselves. What I can't understand is that they have moved us to this new one-stop flight routed via Rome. Yet they are still, as of the 17th March 2024, marketing direct non-stop flights from Addis Ababa to Milan arriving at 05:50am. If they do not have a direct non-stop flight to Milan they need to stop this fraudulent/misleading practice of marketing and selling this route and specified arrival time. Fully disclosing the Rome one-stop flight and the correct arrival time in Milan when the ticket is purchased from them initially. The only other thing that I can think, is that if they do in fact offer a direct non-stop flight as marketed & sold on the website/associated travel agencies, is that if they do not have sufficient customers to fill their seats on both of these flights that they combine the two flights inconveniencing their customers (cost/travel plans). Resulting in a delayed arrival time in Milan. I am bringing this practice to the attention of the public at large, so that there is a future record of this bad business practice by Ethiopian Airlines and as a warning that it does not look like there is a direct non-stop flight to Milan from Addis Ababa. Even though this is market and sold as one on there website. They also sell/market a one-stop flight via Rome with correct arrival information at a slightly discounted rate to the direct Milan option. One should anticipate flight scheduled changes, to the non-stop Milan flight booking, to include an additional stop in Rome once your ticket is paid for. This is premeditated, misleading and false advertising. When we took the Rome stopover up with the call centre they informed us that our flight details had not changed and the Rome stopover was always included in the flight. We then asked them to show us how this was possible to stop in Rome, refuel and still get to Milan by 05:50am. They then changed their story to say that Rome was not included originally. I have kept the recorded screenshots of the routes being marketed and sold on Ethiopian Airlines webpage currently.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

They offered us a free hotel stay overnight. We were hesitant, our Agent recommended a new itinerary with another stop in johannesberg which would allow a connection the same day to our final destination. the Airline refused to allow it. We asked several times as to the hotel we would be in and the only response we got is that it would be a ""tourist quality"" hotel. We did not know what that was and neither did the Agent. After some research we found out that the airline owns a hotel at the airport. Our research showed that it was a decent hotel. Online, travelers that had experienced this problem said that we should get our hotel voucher and check the hotel carefully. being a bit weary , we made reservations at a different hotel, cancel-able until 2 pm local time which was an hour ahead of our local time in Capetown. When we checked in in Capetown, we were given a voucher that showed we were booked in the airline owned Hotel, so we canceled our reservation in the other hotel. Upon arrival in Addis at 10 pm we were informed that we were moved to a different hotel called the Sarem. having no choice at that point, we went to the Sarem, the hotel was shabby and run down, poorly maintained and filthy. The bathroom was so bad we were afraid to shower. We slept for a few hours and got out of there. The airline clearly mislead us and put us in a fleabag hotel.

Apr,2024.0,ultimately delayed by 4 hours,Addis Ababa,Vienna,"This flight was ultimately delayed by 4 hours, which caused several things to go wrong during our further journey. Firstly, a 1 hour delay was announced due to 'technical problems', then another 1 hour due to 'staff problems'. Then it is said that the flight has been moved to 4:30, so an additional 2 hours. After this, water and dinner are provided, for which thanks, but we can hardly sit anywhere. You are not allowed to take a seat in restaurants in the area. This should have been communicated between employees and a plan made. We then leave unclear what will happen next with the adjacent flight that we will miss; this was the 7 hour flight from Vienna to Amsterdam. An employee says they are going to rebook and we are receiving emails. We never received this. We arrive in Vienna and here Austrian airlines can solve it for you. They book a flight to Amsterdam via Frankfurt, which is first delayed to 7:30 PM and later cancelled. This leaves us stuck in Frankfurt. Then we had to rebook again to come to the Netherlands. We received this via Hannover, 9:10 on April 16. Initially there was no hotel included and we had to call Ethiopian airlines. Called this and the employee on the other end seemed to have poor English or had difficulty understanding us due to the connection. We understood her clearly. She tells us that ET has no accommodation and so we have to be on our own. Fortunately, we were still able to get a hotel voucher with dinner and breakfast from KLM. So they had provided something. A received respons from ET said this: First of all, we would like to thank you for choosing Ethiopian Airlines for your trip to Africa. We are deeply sorry and want to apologize for the inconveniences caused to you by the delay of flight ET 724 on 14.04.2024 from Addis Ababa Vienna. Of course, this does not comply with the high expectations of quality and service that Ethiopian Airlines promises and that our customers can expect on all of our flights. Regarding your claim for compensation due to the delay of the flights, we are sorry to tell you that Ethiopian Airlines is not able to meet your demands. The EG No. 261/2004 act from 17th December 2004 Art. 9 and the verdict of the EuGH from 19th November 2009 refer only to domestic flights or flights that depart from EU-countries and airlines that are registered in the EU. The settlement regarding compensation payment unfortunately is not applicable in your case which means that Ethiopian Airlines is not liable for compensation. Thank you for understanding that we cannot give any refunds for neither lump-sum payments nor subsequent damages like missed holidays or appointments. It is our utmost concern that you can put your trust in Ethiopian Airlines again on future flights, where we would be happy to prove our reliability to you once again.

As a top tier member in the Star Alliance I was excited to redeem points for my friend to join us on vacation in Dubai. When I booked the ticket through United, I was assured everything looked good on their end. I took it upon myself to call Ethiopian directly. They told me everything looked fine as it was ticketed. I specifically asked the rep if I needed to show up in person to verify my documents since the miles were coming from my account. I was told no, everything was fine. Fast forward to the day of travel weeks later... my friend gets checked in but they want to see my documents. I forward them. He is issued a boarding pass and sent to the gate.

When he asked to speak with the manager he was sent to an office nearly an hour away from the airport where he was further disrespected. He missed the flight. After getting told all kinds of untruths as to why he was removed, he was eventually told he could fly the next day....they said United Airlines emailed them and verified his travel. United said they do not verify information via email. Thankfully the next day he was able to fly and get to Dubai. Of course when he landed his checked luggage did not make it. In fact it did not arrive for another FOUR days. When I sought answers I could not reach anyone at Ethiopian. I called the United 1K desk and they were able to get a contact from Ethiopian reach out to me. That gentleman apologized and said he would look into my issue. SIX MONTHS later, after MULTIPLE attempts to reach them I finally received a 'stock' email offering a $300 travel credit on a future flight or half that value in cash. This entire debacle could've been avoided if my friend was not profiled by some random employee in ACCRA who decided that since they've had a fraud issue with mileage tickets, my friend, too, must be traveling on fraud.

Apr,2024.0,One of the worst trips I've ever taken,Beira,Atlanta International,"Absolutely awful airline. First, my flight out of Beira, Mozambique was cancelled without notice. My colleague had called the airport the morning of my scheduled flight because I was unable to complete check-in online, but they assured it that I could check-in in person, as they were simply experiencing issues with the server. They forgot to mention that there were NO flights for Ethiopian even departing that day. It's a tiny airport - why didn't they know? I arrived to the airport only then to find out my flight had been cancelled and literally nobody could tell us why. So, my colleague took me to the local Ethiopian Airlines office to figure out an alternative. The person who helped us there had a really bad attitude and said something to the effect of us ""making a big deal"" about the cancelled flight. I had been in Mozambique for 3 weeks, which is 10,000 miles from my home, and I had urgent matters to get to back home. But she didn't care. After sitting in the office for an hour, she finally got me a flight out the next day. The next day at the airport, it took 4 people and 30 minutes to get me checked into my flight because, once again, online check-in had not been working. Just before take-off, the flight attendants walked up and down the aisles spraying a continuous stream of some kind of aerosol all over the open, overhead luggage compartments. Loved filling my lungs with whatever that was, and I'm sure it was totally effective for whatever the purpose of it was. My favorite part of the whole journey, though, was definitely the food poisoning I got from one of the delicious airplane meals. I was not able to sleep for the 35-hour journey, and I got to experience the lavatory at all kinds of prohibited times (take-off, taxi, re-fueling). 10/10 would not recommend, and hope to never use it again.",3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,TripAdvisor

Wow, torn and stained seats? Filthy trays? Poor customer service? But I ended up being very pleasantly surprised. ET is a member of the Star Alliance group so my US segments included Delta and United. I have to say, I was crunched in a lot worse in the Delta flight from FL to Atlanta than on the ET flight overseas. The food was great, and free, with complimentary wine. Every time I turned around there was another fresh tasting hot meal or breakfast on the way with pleasant service. I couldn't eat it all. The planes were clean (to start with) but a lot of people were inconsiderate on the overseas flight and tossed stuff everywhere. I was lucky enough to have a great seat mate on the way over to Africa and I also got newer Boeing Dreamliners. The entertainment console had lots of options and free headphones and overnight pillows and blankets in wrappers with socks, cloth eyeshades and a disposable brush and toothpaste were distributed. On the way back, I was able to opt for the emailed ""buy a neighboring seat"" offer that gave me the whole three seat row so I could stretch out for the 17 hour flight back that required a stop in Rome. What a difference that made for about $300 that I was able to pay with my Venture card points. My back, legs, and sanity thanked me. Hint- get seats in the back where they are more likely to stay open if you want a chance at that. I'm now a member of ""Sheba Miles"" with an extra carry-on allowance (had no problem on the way with my Cpap and extra bag with my back up battery for the Serengeti camps and didn't even need to show my medical certificate). Be aware that if you go through Addis Ababa and transfer planes, security there is tight. You will not only go through security before you are allowed in the main terminal but will go through security again before you enter your ET boarding area after transversing the terminal. And ""I have a metal hip replacement"" does not get you out of a pat down. I got touched more during my trip to and from Africa than during the last couple of years before the divorce. LOL. I'm now looking at other places I can travel on ET as many of their segments are reasonably priced. And I miss that kind of curried lemony chicken dish with rice.

I have never been so belittled by a Customer service agent Mulugeta (somebody) who had the nerve to tell me it was not his fault my passport was not valid. He went on to dismiss me and walked away as I was trying to get answers. His final response was that the Skyline hotel in the terminal was for business class travelers only. Two days ago, I looked at this hotel, and it would have cost me $75 for 5 hours. He offered me dinner and a public bench for 10 hours.

On arrival the boarding counters were already closed. Nobody was there to talk to us and apologies for this inconvenience. Nobody was there to direct us on the next move. We were all in panic and finding ways to ask for help. We were directed to the customer service counter which was taking ages just to rebook a new ticket for a new flight. One person's booking could take 45 min just to book. We were given a flight for the following day, which would take us to Dubai then from Dubai another flight to Doha. We spent 2 days just to reach Doha. We were taken to a hotel to spend the night, and in the hotel the staff are not welcoming. They talk rudely and they lack respect and lack of training on how to handle customers. On arrival to Doha, our luggage was missing and we were told we would be called when our luggage arrives.

Jun,2024.0,the luggage was never loaded,Bangkok,Kigali,"Our flight ET629 was delayed by over 5 hours owing to bad weather, resulting in our missed connection to Kigali. To cut a long story short, it was a nightmare to get ourselves on the next available flight. They had inexplicably put us on the following morning’s flight which would have meant that we missed 2 days of our tour instead of 1. They had the audacity initially to ask for additional payment of USD250 each for the earlier flight when we were prepared to downgrade from business to economy!. It was only with the intervention of 1 kind staff in ADD airport, that we managed ultimately to get on the next flight to Kigali. Arriving well past mid-night, we had a rude shock when we realised our luggage did not make it. This despite our conscientious checks at every leg of the travel with the ET staff. Every single one claimed that our luggage was loaded. It turned out that either every single one lied or the system was wrong. Through Star Alliance, we subsequently realised the luggage was never loaded in the first place from Bangkok. Adding insult to injury, not once did ET apologize for the ordeal or contact us. We only learnt that our luggage arrived the next morning when the Rwanda Lost Luggage personnel called our agent to inform him. We requested ET to provide us with official confirmation of the various delays (in support of our insurance claims) and was again sent on a “not so merry go round” with again “sympathetic noises made” but no action or follow up. On the return flight, they refused to check in our luggage to the final destination in Singapore, claiming that they could not do so as our final leg was with Singapore Airlines. This despite the fact that Singapore Airlines is part of Star Alliance. It should be noted that Singapore Airlines was able to check our luggage in from Singapore to Kigali. In a separate call with Singapore Airlines, the staff confirmed that ET should have checked the luggage in all the way to Singapore. So again, we were severely stressed as we had to clear customs in Bangkok, collect our bags and check in again for our flight to Singapore. All to be done within 2 hours. Lo and behold, we ran to the luggage belt only wait and subsequently see “Delayed Baggage” - no explanation, no apology. It was nothing short of a miracle for us to eventually make it on our Singapore Airline flight. To be fair, the service from the crew on board was good, the food was fair and the beverages good. But the rest of the ground staff (other than the one solitary gem - Amen) are a disgrace. I will not recommend anyone to take this airline.",2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

On some occasions, ET will place us on the big Boeing with screens and entertainment, but my screen wouldn't work ... the flight attendant offered me the worst seat (next to the toilet).

The airline as per their policy offered me an in-terminal hotel. On check-in at JFK New York, the agent offered me a voucher for a Presidential hotel. I reiterated that I would not be able to leave the airport. She then said I could change my voucher on arrival in Addis Ababa at the customer service desk. My first experience in flight started with my screen being damaged with lines across the screen, seat 24H. I stayed in the same seat during our layover in Abidjan. On arrival in Addis, I was referred to the Interlink office. I have never been so belittled by a Customer service agent who had the nerve to tell me it was not his fault my passport was not valid. He went on to dismiss me and walked away as I was trying to get answers. His final response was that the Skyline hotel in the terminal was for business class travelers only. Two days ago, I looked at this hotel, and it would have cost me $75 for 5 hours. He offered me dinner and a public bench for 10 hours. I walked back to the customer service desk who offered me access to the gold lounge. He took me to a quiet room I could use, and as a woman, he allowed me to sleep in a darkened room with 4 strange men.

No bag made it to the destination until a week later when the bags were delivered tied in trash bags because everything was bad, stinky and begging to mold. I had bought clothes for the children and other necessities because they had nothing. After calling and emailing the airline without any response, I went to the airport meeting with their managers (dont want to mention their names) a few times. I was told they don't compensate for food items and in addition if the food was well packaged it would not have messed up the other things. All the food items the kids had for the summer holidays got spoiled and destroy some other personal items. It's not the first we are experiencing a delay with ethiopian airline but the amount of loss for this, especially when they vividly remembered our luggage and the condition of it was too much.

They have zero interpersonal skills and ignore everyone. I asked where my seat was and got the comment are you serious. Really! Disgraceful. There were ignorant people moving around the cabin during taxi and takeoff and the cabin crew did and said nothing. They were completely clueless and didn’t care. A huge health and safety breach. The cabin and seats were dirty and there were no clean blankets. I was left waiting for 25 minutes for a glass of water and had my call button cancelled 3 times. In the end I had to walk to the cabin crew and ask for water. I was told we will get water to you when we are not busy. They were sat around talking. My tv screen was not working like most others so I had to endure a 10 hour flight with no entertainment. Yet again the cabin crew didn’t care. If you can’t even get the simple things right like a tv how can be expected to service an aircraft and keep it flying. I was then kept waiting 3 hours for my hotel voucher and another hour to check into the worst hotel ever. What a joke. 4 meals in this hotel were exactly the same for breakfast lunch and dinner. The food was disgusting and cold. A huge food hygiene problem here that will obviously make people sick. I then returned to the airport only to be met by a huge woman at the security belt who began to scream at me and spit in my face and continued to scream at me even when her manager arrived. He approached me afterwards and apologised for her disgraceful behaviour. I made a complaint about my first flight before I left the airport but I am not expecting a reply.

Jun,2024.0,Awful Business Class,Johannesburg,Addis Ababa Africa,"I have to fly with Ethiopian Airlines often due to a limited airline selection on certain routes. There are many things that frustrate me regarding the airline on every journey. Firstly, all of their flights between Johannesburg and Addis take off late at night. This route is always full, yet they only fly a B737 (a small plane) on this leg. Not only does this mean that you don't get a lie-flat bed for a night flight, but it also means the plane is often has issues with luggage capacity. Despite having ""priority"" luggage in Business Class, they've taken my bags off several times before, so my luggage arrives at the destination late. What confuses me about this is that, on other routes which I fly with them regularly, they fly much bigger planes, but the planes are never full (often quite empty). On all flights, on all routes, there are always crew in uniform flying in Buisiness Class. If you book your seat and the crew want it, the crew will get priority. Business Class will sometimes be fully booked, yet several seats are taken for travelling crew. Why can't they sit in economy, and the Business Class seats be provided to paying customers. They will also move all your carry-on luggage to make sure the crew's luggage is conveniently located for them, but not for the paying customer. I find this as a blatant disregard for paying passengers, particularly when they've paid a premium for Business Class. Addis airport is also a nightmare for connecting flights. 1 - they have a large number of metal detectors and baggage x-ray machines, yet they only ever have two or three open, even when there is a large influx of passengers that have landed. This shows poor planning - they know 10 flights are arriving at a specific time, and means that it's slow and stressful to pass through into the airport. It's also very disorganised. 2 - the business class lounge is much too small to accommodate customers at peak times. It can often be hard to find a seat. 3 - they've recently implemented a new way of boarding flights. They now board several different flights with similar departure times at the same gate. This is initially very confusing as you arrive at the correct gate to find that they're boarding another flight. You have to stand around in a designated box area and wait for them to call your flight - there's no seating, and you'll often be stood waiting to be borded to board for 40 mins after your ""gate"" was supposed to open for boarding. (I don't know what was wrong with the old way of boarding flights at their own gates).",3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Jun,2024.0,Ethiopian Airlines flight to Johannesburg a nightmare,Addis Ababa,Johannesburg Africa,"I travel almost every weekend between Addis and Joburg. I have no choice but to use ET airlines as they have the only direct flights between these locations. First concern is that they use the ET858 plane which is NOT ideal for international flights. The plane is small and uncomfortable. No entertainment for economy class for 5 hours! the lavatories always malfunction (I travel weekly so its the same awful plane). the one lavatory's door doesn't work. a few weeks ago a passenger was stuck in the toilet for 30 minutes before the flight attendant finally managed to open. The question is: why don't they fix the broken door? On some occasions, ET will place us on the big Boeing with screens and entertainment, but my screen wouldn't work...the flight attendant offered me the crappiest seat (next to the toilet). I declined, and she wasn't even bothered, no apology. My colleague saw cockroaches in the the same ET858 flight to Johannesburg a week ago. The final stroke is when they wanted to take our hand luggage because there was no space in the plane (Joburg to Addis on 9th June 2024). That's inappropriate as ET knows very well that their plane is small, but to save costs (at the passengers expense) they will transport us in those small MAX planes with screens and a toilet that don't properly work. Oh, did I mention how dirty the planes will sometimes be when I have boarded the plane I would still see papers and crisp bits on the ground, I doubt they are properly disinfected. I'm utterly disappointed by the low level of standard in the Ethiopian airlines flights to South Africa.

Jun,2024.0,ET 318 ruins a stellar experience,Toronto,Nairobi International,"I first used Ethiopian Airlines in 2007. It was on my recent trip that I noted a general slip in customer service standards. The usually smiling crew had private moments of unhappiness. On ET 318 in particular there was a tone of aggression that I haven't experienced in airlines I have flown let alone the ET of my recent trip. A 3 hour stop-over turned into 6-hours. We were ""herded"" (as opposed to invited) into the Silver lounge by two gentlemen for lunch. Their tone could be likened to a mother scolding errant children with words like ""Silver lounge! Quick! Quick!"" ""When you are finished eating you should go back to the GATE!"" Once assembled at the B3 GATE an announcement is then made for everyone to walk back to the A gates. One wonders why that could not have been said while all passengers were having lunch at the Silver lounge. The ET 318 experience was the most disappointing thus far flying Ethiopian Airlines.

Am sure this will find you well regardless of what I am about to disclose to you. I travelled recently on your airbus ET319 connecting via Addis Ababa on ET624 to Muscat on 27th evening and arrived on 28th red eye. The unexpected happened .For many of the passengers of course. My bag never arrived, I proceeded to file for lost or delayed baggage as protocol dictates. After over 48hrs of distress and endless unanswered calls to follow on my bag , and despite being promised it would be retrieved within the shortest period being the next day , no help was availed to me . Not until I went to your online portal , sent a number of distress messages, only then did I receive a message to collect the bag. to my disbelief . items were broken , missing and definitely not in good condition. One of the very kind staff at the bag collection for Oman Air did provide a name and number of a Mr. Yelakah +968 72500411 whom i contacted for help. A ll i got from him when i enquired for a form that i could fill-in my complaint or process to file for one bore no fruits. Nothing could be done, not even an agent from Ethiopian airlines to meet me in my time of distress. so much for customer service i must say. it appeared to me more biased for if i were an American passport holder or diplomat this would have been handled faster and much swifter, but not a Kenyan woman traveling alone unaccompanied. No one bothered. your other competitors cared much more than your team. It is such a disgrace that i have flown with you for the last ten years and this is what loyalty is paid like for such an esteemed company. i am in the same field hospitality managing and attending to thousands of clients daily. this is unacceptable in any given circumstances. i made it to flight on time. so should have my bags. and in the case of unavoidable circumstances, a little delay doesn't cause any harm as long as my bags arrive in its original condition. for yalekah to tell me nothing can be done is such bullocks. i demand accountability on the part of you team's negligence, luggage handlers or storekeepers i don't care. All customers should be accorded the same level of respect and service regardless of what passport they hold. I have attached files and images to show the extent of damage made on my belongings. I have stolen / missing items including smartwatch. jewelleries, bottles of perfumes and some foreign currency. It is Frustrating and disenchanting that a star alliance airline as yourself would have this done to any of your clients, young /old. new or frequent flyer.

I was very excited to have booked this trip with my family from atlanta USA to Kigali Rwanda for my sisters wedding. Our experience was not up to par for what I would expect out of a reputable airline. The airline was unprofessional, unorganized and treated us customers like second-hand citizens. We were not given clear instructions on the check-in process and the process was very different from other airlines. And very TIMELY. We arrived to the airport 3-4 hours early and were amongst the last to board our flight due to Ethiopian airlines’ alleged “normal processes”. This airline should have provided us with an email outlining erroneous expectations (ie - weight limits for carry-on baggage, extended security screenings, manually hand-written boarding passes, etc). Another major concern that I experienced was the communication issues. From the staff to the computer system, there were serious discrepancies that could have led to safety issues for my family and I. Several times we were told something would take “just a few minutes” and that process ended up taking an hour or more. The airline also issued part of my family handwritten boarding passes and when we arrived into Addis Ababa for our layover to our destination of Kigali, the airline did not have a record of the passengers that had flown off of the manual boarding passes that THEY had provided them with. This almost led to them not being able to board the next flight bc “the system” recorded them as missing the first flight. I have never experienced anything like this before and we unfortunately experienced more of the same upon our return to Atlanta Georgia. I am thankful to be home but I will never trust this airline with my safety or sanity again. At the end of the day I wish I was warned about the unprofessional and unsafe practices of this airline.

If you don’t have time to read what happened to me that’s the main takeaway from this entire story. Pay extra for another airline, Ethiopian flights are cheaper because they give disgusting customer service. They’re so unkind and ill mannered. I wish I’d gotten the names of everyone I spoke to but I was so disoriented by this experience at the time. I had to write this review just to vent and get this off my chest cause I AM LIVID! My first time flying with Ethiopian was the worst travel experience of my life, and I fly frequently as a journalist. I've flown with many airlines, but this was by far the worst. 48 hours before my flight, it was changed because Bulawayo no longer has departures on Saturdays. They issued me a ticket to Addis Ababa but failed to provide my connecting flight to Gatwick. In Bulawayo, they told me they couldn’t print my ticket and that I should collect it in Addis Ababa. When I arrived in Addis Ababa at 9:38 PM, (Ethiopian time - screenshots included of me telling my mother what was happening) the customer service agent was eating and drinking. She started serving another customer while helping me and ended up giving him my passport. She then had to go searching for him and found him after five minutes but didn’t apologize, instead rudely asked why I was talking to another passenger in the queue behind me. Such a mistake could have left me stranded in Ethiopia for weeks waiting for a new passport from the British Embassy. When I asked her to print my ticket, she refused. I went to the complaints customer service desk, but the male agent there walked away in the middle of our conversation to serve another customer. A third agent finally helped but initially blamed me for not flying on Saturday, something completely out of my control. Most agents didn’t speak conversational English, leaving me clueless about what was happening. Eventually, they printed my ticket. Ethiopian, you’ve been voted the best airline in Africa seven times, but your customer service was atrocious. I suffered from severe anxiety, stomach aches, chest pain, heart palpitations and physical discomfort the entire flight home because of what I faced at this airport.

This happened to my elderly mother, a woman in her 80s with limited mobility, who Ethiopian Airlines inexplicably refused to board her long-awaited flight from Accra to Atlanta on August 17, 2024. A nightmare followed: an appalling customer service experience that left her stranded in Ghana while the airline ignored our pleas. If you are considering Ethiopian Airlines, especially for the holiday season, heed this warning: their customer service ranks among the worst in the industry. They operate with no accountability, no empathy, and no respect for the people who trust them. The Shocking Refusal: Abandoning an Elderly Passenger My mother had been planning her visit to the U.S. for months. We booked her Ethiopian Airlines flight, code CFNFQS, scheduled for August 17th, and even arranged for their “Meet and Assist” service, designed to offer wheelchair assistance and attentive care for elderly passengers. Every detail was prepared, every arrangement secured—or so we thought. But when she arrived at Kotoka International Airport in Accra, Ethiopian Airlines’ supervisor, (Edward A. Parker), blocked her from boarding. His vague reasoning? “Medical reasons”. However, he never explained further, nor did he provide any documentation or reach out to the family member who booked her ticket. The airline’s silence was chilling. Ethiopian Airlines had both my contact information and the option to explain why a paying, elderly customer with limited mobility was suddenly unfit to board. Yet they did nothing. No call, no email, no apology. Their complete disregard for my mother’s distress in Ghana went beyond poor customer service. It was inhumane. Desperate for Answers: Two Months of Silence In the aftermath, I contacted Ethiopian Airlines repeatedly, reaching out through every possible channel: emails to their CEO, messages to customer service, and calls to their Accra airport management. Surely, I thought, they would want to address such an egregious oversight. I was wrong. Weeks turned into months without a single response. The silence was deafening. Initially, I connected with Mrs. Meron Masresha, the Team Leader at Ethiopian Airlines' Global Customer Interaction Center at Bole International Airport. She forwarded my complaint to Mr. Abiy Solomon, the Accra Airport Services Manager, who even requested my nephew’s contact details to discuss the incident directly. After I provided them, Ethiopian Airlines vanished once again—no follow-up, no email, no acknowledgment. It was as though my mother’s traumatic experience did not exist. A Blatant Breach of Trust This debacle extended beyond a simple inconvenience; it shattered the very foundation of trust. Ethiopian Airlines’ refusal to respond or provide even basic compensation reveals their blatant disregard for their customers. Their policies state that denied boarding compensation applies when a passenger meets all check-in requirements and is refused boarding for reasons beyond their control. My mother fulfilled every requirement, yet received no compensation, no refund, and no answers.",1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,AirlineQuality
Aug,2024.0,the most terrible company,Antananarivo,Brussels,"I started my trip at Antananarivo to Brussels, with a stop in Addis Ababa. At the airport of Antananarivo they could not give me a boarding card for the flight from Addis Ababa to Brussels. They told me to get a boarding card at Addis Ababa airport, but they checked in my luggage to Brussels. At Addis Ababa airport there were many people with problems as I had to wait for 2 hours at the customer service desk. They gave me a stand by ticket and said it would be no problem to get a seat, this was lie number 1. On the boarding card gate A10 was mentioned while on the screens B5 would be the gate to board for the flight ET730. I have asked customer service several times what the correct gate would be. They kept saying the correct gate was A10, even when boarding already started at B7, which was mentioned nowhere and was not on the screens, not even on the screen of gate B7, this was lie number 3. All customers with a stand by ticket, had to wait. Then they closed the door and the plane left without many standby by ticket travellers. Our seats were not secured, the plane was overbooked. After the plane left a supervisor promised us he would take care of an alternative flight, our luggage, compensation, and a place to sleep. Then he ran off and did nothing for us. According to the policy of Ethiopian Airlines they should offer us a hotel to stay. After a few hours I finally managed to get a boarding pass for a flight one day later. I had to spend the night and day at the airport, got no food or drinks, nothing. Ethiopian Airlines is by far the most terrible company I have had a flight with, or actually no flight with.

Aug,2024.0,Stranded and Ignored: The Shocking Customer Service Failure of Ethiopian Airlines,Accra,Atlanta International,"Stranded and Ignored: The Shocking Customer Service Failure of Ethiopian Airlines A Nightmare in the Skies: How Ethiopian Airlines Abandoned Its Customer Picture this: standing at an airport, eagerly awaiting the arrival of a loved one, only to receive a frantic phone call that they’ve been denied boarding—no reason given, no explanation offered, just flat-out rejected. This is precisely the gut-wrenching experience I faced when Ethiopian Airlines unexpectedly refused to allow my elderly mother to board her flight from Accra to Atlanta on August 17, 2024. What followed was a complete and horrifying unraveling of any semblance of customer service, leaving us stranded in a bureaucratic void, with no answers, no assistance, and—most importantly—no accountability. This is not just my story; it is a warning to all travelers. If customer service, respect, and common decency mean anything to you when choosing an airline, stay away from Ethiopian Airlines. My ordeal reveals how easily a company that brands itself as 'world-class' can discard its customers without so much as a second thought. The Callous Refusal: Abandoning a Vulnerable Elderly Passenger My mother, a woman in her 70s, had been looking forward to visiting her family in the U.S. for months. Every detail of her journey was carefully arranged. I booked her ticket (Booking Code: CFNFQS), and made sure she was signed up for Ethiopian Airlines' 'Meet and Assist' program for wheelchair assistance, boarding support, and special attention during her flight—all to accommodate her age and limited mobility. But despite all these meticulous preparations, I was blindsided by a call from my nephews, who were accompanying her to Kotoka International Airport in Accra. My mother had been denied boarding—allegedly for 'medical reasons.' However, no one from the airline bothered to explain what these reasons were. No calls, no emails. Nothing. The only thing clearer than their refusal to help was their total indifference to the situation unfolding before them. The neglect was not just shocking—it was inhumane. How could an airline that claims to care about its customers refuse to board an elderly passenger without even the courtesy of a reason? A Month of Silence: The Complete Absence of Accountability Naturally, I demanded answers. I reached out to Ethiopian Airlines, expecting at least an apology, an explanation—anything to help me understand why my mother had been stranded. After all, this is an airline with a global presence, supposedly flying millions of passengers with care. Surely, they would want to resolve such a serious mistake, right? Wrong. More than a month has passed, and I am still waiting for any semblance of a response. What is most disturbing is not just the lack of communication but the blatant disregard for their paying customers. Multiple follow-ups with Ethiopian Airlines' customer service teams resulted in nothing. I first contacted Mrs. Meron Masresha, Team Leader at the Global Customer Interaction Center at Bole International Airport. She passed my concerns to the Accra Airport team and their Airport Services Manager, Mr. Abiy Solomon. At that moment, I foolishly thought we were making progress. Mr. Solomon requested my nephew’s contact details, promising to reach out and clarify what had happened. I promptly provided the information, thinking that, finally, the nightmare was nearing an end. But I was wrong again. No emails. No phone calls. No answers. Ethiopian Airlines simply vanished into thin air, taking any shred of responsibility with them. It's as if they erased my mother’s experience—and my concerns—from their books entirely. Broken Promises, Broken Trust This story goes beyond the inconvenience of a denied flight. It is a tale of betrayal. Ethiopian Airlines had assured me that my elderly mother would be cared for every step of the way. Instead, they abandoned her without explanation and then refused to provide the services for which we had already paid. Even more appalling is their complete failure to justify their actions. If my mother was denied boarding for medical reasons, where is the proof? Where is the medical documentation? Why didn’t anyone reach out to me, the person who booked the flight, when they had my contact information for exactly such emergencies? Their policies clearly state that denied boarding compensation applies when a passenger meets all check-in requirements and is refused boarding for reasons not outlined in their General Conditions of Carriage. Yet here we are—no compensation, no refund, and no answers. Travelers Beware: The Alarming Reality of Ethiopian Airlines As the holiday season approaches, and many of you plan international travel, heed my warning: Ethiopian Airlines is not a company you can trust. Can you risk being abandoned at an airport, with no explanation, no assistance, and no one to turn to? This airline is failing its customers in ways that go far beyond customer service. It is about basic human decency and respect for the people who trust them with their travel. In my experience, Ethiopian Airlines has shown no respect, no sense of urgency, and absolutely no follow-through on its promises. If this is how they treat a vulnerable elderly passenger, how will they handle an even more serious situation? The Cruel Silence: A Company Without Conscience What makes this ordeal all the more infuriating is the stone-cold silence from Ethiopian Airlines. Mistakes happen; I understand that. But to refuse even the most basic level of communication when something goes wrong? That’s not just bad service—that’s negligence. When you rely on a company to fly you across the world, you deserve a safety net of care and concern. But with Ethiopian Airlines, it’s clear that once something goes wrong, you’re on your own. No apologies, no explanations, and certainly no solutions. It’s as though they simply don’t care. Conclusion: Fly at Your Own Risk We, as customers, deserve better. We deserve airlines that honor their commitments, that communicate openly and transparently, and that treat passengers with the respect they’ve earned by paying for their services. Based on my experience, Ethiopian Airlines fails in all these areas. So as you plan your next trip, think twice before booking with Ethiopian Airlines. If something goes wrong, you won’t just be left stranded at the airport—you’ll be left stranded in a sea of deafening silence. This story isn’t just about poor service; it’s about betrayal. And it’s a betrayal that no traveler should ever have to experience.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Aug,2024.0,Lost Bag and Zero Support,Singapore,Gaborone International,"Absolutely deplorable. The airline customer service has gone way downhill. For contrast - 13 years ago they lost my bag for a total of a few days. They compensated me in the meantime and reconciled me with my things days later while I was in Addis. Great, as you’d expect. This year we flew Ethiopian Airlines. Getting on board at Addis was like a rugby scrum with zero organisation. I was travelling with my family and they changed my seat on me so I was no longer next to them. Annoying but I got over it. The service on board was ok, not very pleasant but fine all in all. When we arrived they had lost my daughter’s check in suitcase. This can happen. “Maybe it will show up tomorrow”, I thought. We got some scribble on a paper to confirm it was missing and awaited contact from them. No such communication was forthcoming. As days passed we started calling offices but just got passed around and eventually onto the contact for lost bags. He would ignore our calls for days on end and hang up on us. My daughter had none of her belongings and there was no offer of compensation for her things we had to purchase which was once the case and still a policy I’ve read on their website. Weeks passed, nothing. We turned up at the airport in Gaborone and an independent airport worker told us we had to wait 25 days to claim for the lost bag. We were just grateful for a form of communication. After waiting a ridiculous 25 days we submitted and nothing happened. Some sales assistants tried to help but they were powerless. 10 days passed, no answer on the phone. Finally, today, more than 40 days after it went missing we have received another form to sign stating we will receive some money - well under the contents value - and forfeit it if the bag is found. I won’t hold my breath however. This airline (and in particular one individual) has failed us in this instance and has shown zero care for their mistake and the effects of losing someone’s bag. I just want to write to advise others to know that having your bag lost with EA is a real possibility and don’t expect any support when it does happen. I’ve learnt to consider bag insurance and to find another option for my future flights.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

My family and I were refused boarding without any valid reason. Despite having all the required documents and being on time for our flight, we were denied access to the plane, and no explanation was given. What made the situation worse was the attitude of the staff. Instead of offering help or even showing basic courtesy, they were rude and dismissive. To our shock, some of the staff members even laughed at us while we were trying to understand why we were being denied boarding. This level of unprofessionalism and lack of empathy is completely unacceptable. Traveling is already stressful, and being treated with such disrespect only adds to the frustration. I expected better from an airline that claims to be a leading carrier in Africa.

Aug,2024.0,"Terrible flight out, great flight home - an airline that can't deal fairly and competently with its customers",London,Lilongwe International,"Our trip TO Malawi with Ethiopian Airlines, which was terrible, could not have been more different from our trip BACK to London, which was excellent. For the trip from London, we paid a fair bit extra to book the two seats in Row 11 (11A and 11C - there was no 11B when we booked) behind the bulkhead for my legroom and elbow room. The trouble began when we came to check in and the aircraft configuration had changed (without any notification) - there was suddenly now an 11B. At Heathrow we were told at check-in that no one would sit between us, as that seat had been ""blocked"". On board, a woman then arrived with a pass for 11B - to sit between us! We complained and the attendant took her away. Then suddenly a rude man, who failed to introduce himself, marched up to us and ordered us to make way: ""We cannot have this,"" he said. ""Move those things - this is a commercial flight."" And then marched off. This caused huge embarrassment to the woman with the 11B ticket, to us, to the cabin crew, and nearby passengers. She agreed to take 11C and was perfectly charming - we felt as sorry for her as we did for ourselves. Then at Addis, the transfer was a shambles, with the gate staff putting us on a bus and 15 minutes later ordering us off the bus - and then away from the gate. But because there was nowhere to go, everyone stayed at the gate. Eventually, we boarded the aircraft, and arrived in Lilongwe late. We then waited and waited for my bag, along with about 25 other people - and amid mountains of lost bags from previous flights. My bag hadn't made it - but by the time we were sure of this, the queue for reclaiming lost bags was more than 30 minutes long! A whole trolley must have been left off at Addis. Retrieving it took five days, with very little help from Ethiopian. I only got it back after five days because we arranged to have it collected ourselves - involving a five-hour round trip. Airlines are becoming the new insurance companies for appalling customer service in the administration department. Getting questions answered and matters dealt with is at best miserable and at worst non-existent. It seems that if everything goes smoothly, it's fine, but as soon as an issue arises, the customer care disintegrates. We gave up on trying to ensure our flight home would be less of a fiasco - and, incredibly, it all went perfectly, largely because the aircraft we booked to fly on was the same as the one actually on the runway and so our seats were correct. Addis international departures building is also new and splendid, unlike the internal Africa building. We would have forgiven and forgotten about the Addis shambles and maybe even the lost bag if only Ethiopian had been honest and up-front about the changed seat configuration - letting us know and returning some or all of the extra we had paid to secure the two-seat option.

Aug,2024.0,"The most horrible ""flight"" experience ever!",Addis Ababa,Brussels International,"I started my trip at Antananarivo to Brussels, with a stop in Addis Ababa. At the airport of Antananarivo they could not give me a boarding card for the flight from Addis Ababa to Brussels. They told me to get a boarding card at Addis Ababa airport, but they checked in my luggage to Brussels. At Addis Ababa airport there were many people with problems as I had to wait for 2 hours at the customer service desk. They gave me a stand by ticket and said it would be no problem to get a seat, this was lie number 1. On the boarding card gate A10 was mentioned while on the screens B5 would be the gate to board for the flight ET730. I have asked customer service several times what the correct gate would be. They kept saying the correct gate was A10, even when boarding already started at B7, which was mentioned nowhere and was not on the screens, not even on the screen of gate B7, this was lie number 3. All customers with a stand by ticket, had to wait. Then they slammed the door in our face and the plane left without many Stan by ticket travellers. Our seats were not secured, the plane was overbooked. I think this is really stupid as Ethiopian Airlines should know how many seats are in any of their airplanes. This is lie number 4. After the plane flew away a supervisor promised us he would take care of an alternative flight, our luggage, compensation, and a place to sleep. Then he ran off and did nothing for us. These are lies 5, 6, 7 and 8. According to the policy of Ethiopian Airlines they should offer us a hotel to stay.

Ethiopian Airlines is by far the most terrible company I have had a flight with, or actually no flight with. The personnel are extremely rude and keep lying.

Aug,2024.0,For Travel Within Europe Choose A Different Airline,Vienna,Copenhagen Europe,"Flying with Ethiopian Airlines from Vienna to Copenhagen was the second cheapest option available, despite being a direct flight compared to others with layovers. However, the price was still relatively high at around $181 per person before additional fees, which was likely due to booking within a week of departure. Unfortunately, the experience was disappointing. Boarding was delayed, and I initially assumed it was due to cleaning, but I was wrong. When we finally boarded, it was evident that passengers from an earlier leg of the flight from Addis Ababa were continuing on to Copenhagen. The plane was in a state of disarray, resembling the aftermath of severe turbulence, with blankets and pillows strewn across the cabin. The overall cleanliness was subpar, with a noticeable layer of grime on many surfaces. Compared to other flights I’ve taken with American and European airlines, this was by far the dirtiest and most outdated plane I’ve encountered. The aircraft appeared to have not been updated or thoroughly cleaned in decades, and even business class didn’t seem much better. On a positive note, the staff were very friendly, which was a small silver lining in an otherwise lackluster experience. Upon arrival in Copenhagen, we disembarked at what seemed to be the farthest edge of the airport. Having flown to CPH numerous times, I had never experienced such a distant arrival gate. The disembarkation process was slow, so we decided to wait until most passengers had left before leaving our seats. Additionally, since this was a connecting flight from outside the Schengen zone, we had to go through passport control at both the departure and arrival airports. While this might be a perk for those who enjoy collecting passport stamps, (although expected) it added an extra layer of inconvenience to the journey.",1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Unfortunately, there are not many options available. Therefore, Ethiopian Airways abuses the situation by charging extortionary pricing. For example, the price of a JNB-LLW return flight on a dilapidated 737 is higher than that of a return flight to Europe. Additionally, their website is primitive, and I have yet to make a successful booking and payment. Today, I made three attempts and have given up.

Aug,2024.0,Worst flight I have ever been on including budget airlines,Dubai,Zanzibar Island International,"Quite possibly the worst flight I have ever experienced beginning with the chaotic check in to the complete shambles when boarding the flight. There was no policing of hand luggage and people were bringing 3-4 boxes including KFC buckets which they stored in the overhead lockers. The toilets were blocked and the crew were so utterly disengaged that they actually went to sleep for the second half of the flight, paying no attention to passengers even when they asked for water. When we landed in Addis, passengers got up from their seats when the plane was still on the runway and the crew just ignored it. One crew member just sat in her seat whilst the passengers disembarked. The entertainment screens were never switched on for the duration. The next sector was from Addis to Zanzibar which was another chaotic boarding process. It's like they have never done this before. The two buses just dropped off the passengers at the front and rear doors and the ensuing chaos was entirely predictable. There was no thought given to the fact that passengers in rows 15+ were entering the front of the plane and vice versa. Trying to get to row 15 from the rear door was ridiculous. The Airbus A350-900 was much better than the Dreamliner on the previous sector but once the meal was served, the crew were literally not sighted until we landed. Not even once were they seen!

The seating arrangement is also below that of other airlines in that window seat passengers have to pass another passenger to get into the aisle. The business class cabin of the A350 seems cramped, especially when full as was the case on the Addis to Geneva sector. The transfer procedure at Addis is substandard. There were 2 security checks when one should suffice as is the case at most other large international hubs. This is a nuisance as one has to take off shoes and unpack cabin bags twice. When walking to the departure gate at Addis, I faced an almighty queue for a boarding pass check. This was the forth time I had to present boarding pass and passport with a 5th coming at the gate itself. The in terminal check did not have a fast track lane for business class passengers and it took 20 minutes of shoving and pushing to get through.

I booked and had a confirmation for a flight from Atlanta to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I don't live in Atl so I had booked an early morning flight from Orlando to ATL on a different airline so I could make this connection. Ethiopian airlines cancelled the ATL flight and just moved me to a different airport (Dulles in DC) without any notification. I only found out because I noticed the departing airport was different when I opened the app even though online by reservation still showed ATL. I called them to get it straightened out and that is when I was informed they had moved me to ""the nearest airport"". DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO CONCEPT OF GEOGRAPHY AND REALIZE THAT ATL TO DULLES ARE NOT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR AN EASY TRANSFER? They offered to book me on a 5am flight from ATL to DULLES so I could make the flight, but when I informed them I don't live in ATL and would need a flight from Orlando to Dulles they refused to assist. Keep in mind that I had previously received a text message alert from them informing me that the flight time had been changed by 5 minutes, but it still showed it was out of ATL. Therefore, clearly they had contact information and the ability to notify me of this change, but just simply did not do it. I don't know how I would have learned this prior to check-in or even arriving in the wrong city for a flight if I had not decided to download the app and load my trip a week before travel time.

Sep,2024.0,The airline that is shuttling itself down swiftly!!!!,Entebbe,Beirut International,"In the business lounge (cloud 9) there was no water upon my arrival for about 4hrs. I couldn't use the washroom but there was kind stuff there they gave me a bottle from the drinking water and brought water with bucket to flush the bathroom for me to use and then brought another bucket of water for me. Hilarious!! At my destination one of my bags didn't arrive. When I want to the desk office near the luggage collection, a man blindly told me it will come with next flight. I said that is very general statement because he didn't even ask me anything. Then he asked me where my origin was, and I told him Entebbe he repeated the same thing by saying Ethiopian airline every day a luggage is left behind. I started randomly asking people's option and one guy came back to the same guy who told me it will come with next flight asked him if he did a report of delayed language and he answered him saying there is another Ethiopian flight arriving after one hour they have to wait first for that flight to arrive then only they will do the report for delayed luggage. I got a false hope and stood there for another two hours actually. No seat no coffee shop just duty-free items. rooming around I ended buying staff that I didn't plan to buy. After the flight arrived my bag was still not there, and I was not the only one we were about 100 travelers bombarding the desk taking the delayed luggage report. One man was doing the report instead of giving form for the travelers to fill he was filling the form himself he only asked for our passport and boarding passes and luggage tags. The risk there you don't know what he writes but at the end he gives a copy so it can be counter checked. In my case the content was randomly stated as clothes which was not true in reality. I didn't care as I know the airline I had very low expectation. I arrived on 11th Sep. 24, on 12th Sep. tried to contact the airline. There is one good staff in that airport she is called Maya. I contacted her she confirmed the luggage has arrived. on 13th Sep. 24 I asked people who were traveling to Lebanon to pick my luggage because I am based in Syria, a neighboring country. Then I approached the airline what kind of authorization they need to release my bag. There was no response for my two emails one on 12th Sep evening one sent on 13th Sep Moring. Then I decided to just write a note of authorization and give copy of my passport and write an email both to the one in charge at the airport and the area manager telling them the names of the people I autherized. no response no confirmation, Meanwhile, the colleagues who are to help me collect mu luggage are waiting for the detail. Then the airline responded they will not release the luggage to third party I have to go with my passport in the hours of 9am to 5pm by myself. I called the area manager and asked her to deliver or pay the expenses related to my travel from Syria to Lebanon or utilize her responsibility to deliver the luggage. Then she said it is new custom ruling it is not airline and she can't do anything. Then I asked as a delayed luggage I had a right the airline to deliver the luggage within Beirut therefore they should deliver my luggage to Radisson Blue Hotel as my office has contract with hotel and they can help me receive the luggage. The phone conversation ended her promising to return back to me. In the meantime, Radisson Blue Hotel agreed to assist but Ethiopian airline never delivered it to Radisson Blue Hotel. After learning this fact, I called back the area manager, thanks God she picks my call. I asked what their plans are about my luggage, and she says it is not with us it is with custom when it is collected from custom you will receive an email. This kind of response may mean wait forever. So, I don't have my luggage and only God knows when they will release it. I wanted to wait until the time I get my luggage, but nothing will improve. After going thru all these they didn't even say sorry. I spoke across many levels up till the area manager no one has ever said sorry. It seems like they have right to mishandle innocent travelers.

The flight attendants were also not particularly helpful. The passenger sitting next to me spilled some water and I asked the flight attendant for some paper towels. She was serving meals and told me she did not have it and that was that, never offered to help. In a recent 17 hour flights, I called the airlines and booked a aisle seat 3 months before my flight, but the seat assignment was changed at the last minute by the airlines from aisle to window.

Oct,2024.0,First and last time flying with Ethiopian Airlines.,Stockholm,Johannesburg International,"My flights (Business Class) ET715 & ET809 from Stockholm to Addis Ababa and from Addis Ababa to Johannesburg was good, not excellent but good. Good crew, good food and good attention throughout both flights. Snacks and hydration were prioritised, crew checked in with passengers regularly and were available. Both return flights (Business Class) ET808 & ET714 Johannesburg to Addis Ababa and Addis Ababa to Stockholm were terrible in many ways, inflight service very poor, food poor the crew just had no desire to provide a good service they were in my opinion lazy and very inattentive. I had to seek drinks on two occasions by pressing the call button and it took a long time for crew at arrive, on the second occasion after 15 minutes I went to them for water and a snack after the did not respond. I am not a demanding traveller but on flights over 5 and 7 hours drinks and snacks are important. Then the nightmare of damaged luggage on arrival to Stockholm. I reported the damage at the airport, and had it recorded at airport with Ethiopian Airlines appointed baggage service providers and a report was generated, a copy of which I received. The baggage service desk staff was excellent and very professional. I got no response to lodged damaged luggage report from Ethiopian Airlines so I called customer services after 10 days. They told me they awaited additional information, however this information was never requested from me until I called and then I sent is straight to then. I do not know why they needed additional information as the original report was done and submitted by their own agent at the arriving airport and at this point they also inspected the damage with their own eyes and included this in their report. The luggage was not repairable so needed replaced. Then once I provided the additional information the avoidance of their legal responsibility began. A communication asking for a receipt and of course who has that after 15 months and considering the luggage was a gift . Then they decide to not follow the rules and regulations for damaged luggage as set out in international conventions originally the Warsaw Convention then the Montreal Convention and offer an insulting amount £39 (500sek)for a luggage case that cost over £300 pounds only 15 months ago. I respond outlining the context an actual cost of the luggage asking for their reconsideration. They then by email produce an offer and send an image of a case they say is comparable to mine that they find on the internet costing £39 and hold the line of company policy if 500sek if no receipt is produced, using the the legal conventions regulating lost and damaged luggage needs to be the approach not corporate policy. The original report by their own baggage service agent contradicts their offer and conclusions as it outlines the luggage material was aluminium and they send a picture of a cheap plastic luggage case as a comparison related to their offer. In my opinion Ethiopian Airlines moral and ethical compass is not in the direction of doing the right thing or accepting responsibility in any way for their actions and damaged caused. The interest of the passenger is not important and their desire to be honest in settling damaged luggage claims not felt or implemented. In the end I declined their offer as it is insulting and goes against the values I expect from a company that I use to transport me and my luggage across the world and pay well for this service. For me the best approach was to save energy and time knowing that Ethiopian Airlines had no desire to be fair or act with integrity in this situation and move on without any compensation rather than settle for a faction of what it should have been. The money for me was never important or significant, it is the principle that I paid for a service this was not fully provided and I entrusted my luggage to a company to handle it with respect and care, so I expected a wrong to be put right using the law and regulations in place for such a situation. So how do I take my responsibility for the situation and demonstrate my integrity? 1. I will never use the services of Ethiopian Airlines again; I will write this honest review to let others know how they are open to a similar situation when using Ethiopian Airlines. I will encourage others to use airlines with much more integrity than I experienced, as a very regular flyer there are many alternative air carriers I have used and will use in the future. So, my conclusion first time flying Ethiopian Airlines to try their service as I heard and read so many divided reviews, it will be my last time using Ethiopian Airlines because of no consistency in their inflight service and lack of integrity in my opinion of their approach to damaged luggage.",3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,TripAdvisor
Oct,2024.0,Don't fly with them even if it's the last airline on Earth.,Accra,Riyadh International,"I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the worst airline on earth . I wish I had read people's reviews here before I booked with them. I booked a flight with them for my worker from accra to riyadh transit in Addis Ababa and it wasn't cheap its about 560$ for one way. It was the same price of Qatar airline flight which is much better, but I chose this because it was two hours shorter and I wanted my worker to arrive before his visa expired.Then the airlines delayed the flight for 24 hours, claiming that the reason was a bird strike.They made the passengers wait for hours at the airport before telling them, and they did not even apologize, nor did they give them a hotel to rest in during this time, which was a whole day! anf because I'm responsible for the worker, I booked a hotel for him near the airport for $175.Because of the full day delay I also paid money to extend his visa, because he would be late and I would have to pay a late fee.When I contacted them and asked them to compensate me for the trouble they caused, they responded with complete rudeness, and refused to take responsibility for what happened, and that they did not have to compensate me for anything because this delay was beyond their control and due to technical problems, as if this was my problem! And they literally said: ""Pax ticket is also changed with no charge and accepted on today’s flight.""can you believe that? This is so provocative, I don't know why these people still have airline licenses, they're just thugs with crappy planes.They are not efficient and do not obey the rules.they just take people's money. I hope my review was helpful to someone so they don't make the same mistake as me",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,TripAdvisor

Oct,2024.0,Horrible Service and Misinformation,London,Victoria International,"I am one more victim of the poor service by the airline. Our connecting flight was cancelled in Addis Ababa with very short notice and we were stranded in the city for 12 hours in a dingy dirty hotel provided by the airlines. Total chaos as the boarding gate and customer service staff weren’t aware of the cancelled or at least pretended not to know. After a 11 hour delay we reached our destination only to find out they had not brought the luggage for any of the passengers whose flight was cancelled. Our hotel and taxi driver both confirmed at the destination that Ethiopian Airlines was notorious for delaying flights and losing luggages. Regarding compensation, we were lied to and send from pillar to post chasing non-existent staff responsible for an imaginary reimbursement. Shambolic! Do not buy connecting flights from them if you want your precious luggages and enjoy your holiday in peace.",3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,TripAdvisor
Oct,2024.0,"4 flights and a decent experience on all, apart from queuing",London,Antananarivo International,"Felt I should leave a review as our experience was nowhere near as bad as a lot of the reviews on here. Flew from London to Antananarivo via Addis, and back again 3 weeks later. I didn't eat the food on the first leg as I was asleep, but my friend had the fish curry and suffered from it, stomach-wise, for the next few days. The food I had on the other 3 legs was uninspiring but adequate and edible, no complaints. I only used the toilet on one of the four flights and it was fine, not dirty or out of order. The staff weren't effusively friendly but they were not unfriendly either, and they had to deal with some quite challenging passengers in a group who kept trying to sit down in random seats when we boarded - they were polite and efficient in doing so. The entertainment system worked perfectly on all 4 flights. There weren't any recent blockbuster movies but there was a wide selection with plenty that I wanted to watch. On the way there, we only had a 2-hour layover in Addis, but our luggage got transferred with no problems. 3 of our flights were on time. The last leg, back to London, was an hour late, which was no problem for us but might have been for other passengers. There was absolutely no acknowledgement of this either on boarding or on arrival. Legroom was actually very good, better than on some more upmarket airlines I have been on recently. Although the greeny-brown patterned seats look a bit dated, decor-wise, I can't say I found the aeroplanes either dirty or ill-maintained - my experience was that they were clean. The main issue is the interminable queueing everywhere. At Heathrow, on departure, the self-service bag drop terminals weren't working so there was a massively long and slow-moving queue to drop bags, despite having checked in online. The same at Antananarivo on departure to come home. And Addis Ababa airport, despite being modern (and, despite other reviews, I would say that yes it does have food and drink outlets - no problem there), seems to take queueing at security to another level. We had 2 or 3 more security checks inbetween our two flights, each with a massive queue. That was the biggest pain. Given my own experience, I probably would fly Ethiopian again, though, having read others' reviews, maybe we just struck lucky this time.",4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Oct,2024.0,Sour taste - never to be repeated!,London,Kilimanjaro National Park International,"We recently travelled to see our sick elderly grandmother in Kilimanjaro. I was nervous about using Ethiopian after reading some of the reviews here but bit the bullet and thought I would give them the benefit of doubt since they claim to be the best African airline for the past several years!! We started at Heathrow bound for Addis, check in security etc all normal until we boarded their airbus A350 and boy what a poorly maintained aircraft it was! In fact my only reason for booking it was me thinking they use A350 which is a relatively new aircraft how bad can they be, it’s only when you see the state of their economy cabin, smell the stench from their dilapidated toilets onboard three of which had issues with the door lock, we had to hold the door when we went to the toilet as neither did the lock engage nor did the light warning others that the toilet was occupied illuminate!! The seating is cramped and uncomfortable at best it’s as if they told the airbus designers to cram as many seats as possible without any room to move, (must be the case, I have done BA to Dubai in an A350 and it was spacious and comfortable). This was not so here! For me the worst part of the whole experience is poorly trained and rude cabin crew, on all 4 separate flights we found the same level of substandard service almost as if they were being brought to work with a gun to their heads!! To sum it all up, never would i recommend ET and never ever would I fly with them again! There is only one positive I can add, the flights all departed and landed on time but for me where the service levels are so poor it really left a sour taste and I would never fly with them again!

There seems to be less leg room then with other airlines, (economy). Very dated safety video. They don’t come around with the occasional drink like other airlines do. Bole international airport seemed slightly shambolic, and had a depressing ‘feel’. The Ethiopian airlines background music is still going around my head 5 days after the flight, and I hated it.

Oct,2024.0,Absolute Disgusting Experience with Ethiopian Airlines,Sao Paulo,Dubai International,"My company purchased a ticket for me to attend a global business fair in Dubai. When I arrived at the check-in, I was shocked when Ethiopian Airlines requested that the person who bought the ticket appear in person to sign a paper to confirm the purchase. Really? In 2024? The payment was made through our company’s financial team using a virtual credit card, a standard and secure payment method. Even after the person came to the airport and confirmed all the documents and information, they still refused to let me board. There was no prior communication in the booking confirmation or email saying they did not accept virtual credit cards. They insisted on a physical card, which doesn’t make any sense, especially when the company owner was present with all the necessary documents. I ended up missing my flight, which caused me to lose out on important business. Ethiopian Airlines not only provides terrible service but operates with questionable practices. I’ve traveled with many airlines worldwide, but this was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had. They’re dishonest, their service is appalling, and they seem completely unprofessional. To make matters worse, the treatment I received from the staff felt discriminatory, and our legal team will be taking action on this.

Unfortunately, I couldn’t reissue the certificate since I received my vaccination abroad.

Oct,2024.0,Thankyou Solomon,London,Cape Town Central International,"Used the airline several times, to fly to and from South Africa, when I volunteer . The flight has one change at Addis Ababa. All if the staff that you come into contact with a friendly and proffessional. The food on board is great and the comfort on board is as good as any economy plane journey. I have only ever had one issue with this airline, when a suitcase was irretrievably lost going home, which wasn't a pleasant experience. Mainly due to the lack of customer support available, which the airline needs to work on and is the only reason I wouldn't give then full marks. In the end though I have to say a huge thanks to Solomon Worku, manager at Heathrow Airport, for assisting me in the compensation process and for looking after me the next time I flew with them. I would always fly with Ethiopian Airlines, but would just urge them to work on customer support by email and telephone to offer people a better experience if things go wrong (as unfortunately they can when travelling for one reason or another).",3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

So this airline not informed us at all, the crew was standing by the counter not saying a word at all for 6 hours. We only been informed twice just saying the flight is delayed to 3am and then to 5pm however this only happened because frustrated passengers claimed information by the counter and then the passenger was yelling to all the other passengers the information at approx 5 am that they still do not know if we going to fly or to go to hotels. We only been offered once meals during 6 hours in a small silver lounge where only 1/4 of patients fit in, no air, no seats. No free calls or emails possibility for us been provided. On the plane only 1 meal option, they not even provide vegetarian option at all. Following 6 hours delay not even an apology or explanation of reason of delay.

Shortly after takeoff, the TV entertainment stopped working in my row of 3 seats. I glanced at a few other monitors and all seemed to be in my state. The tv screens didn’t respond to button presses or screen touch. This means, for the 11 hours, there was no entertainment. The button for overhead light also stopped working.

Nov,2024.0,I felt like I was back in the 90's,Hong Kong,Copenhagen,"HKG-BKK-ADD-LAD-ADD-VIE-CPH Ethiopian is not the worst airline I've ever flown, but it's definitely not very good. Cabin crew fluctuated between friendly and helpful, to unenthusiastic with a feeling that they had given up making an effort a long time ago. Most of the planes I flew were old. With touch screens that didn't work, and with a joystick where you press the buttons to control a mouse cursor that sloooowly moves across the screen. I felt like I was back in the 90's. The wifi did not work on roughly 75% of the flights I was on. When it did, the speeds were quite good. Toilets were, on some of the flights, disgusting. They were definitely not cleaned or refreshed regularly, and smelled really bad. On other flights they were okay. On the ADD-VIE-CPH leg the plane was a dreamliner, with more modern seats and screens. However, the inflight entertainment system was riddled with bugs. No movies would play without buffering and stuttering, making it impossible to watch for more than 10 seconds. Many screens were stuck in a neverending reboot sequence, even though the crew kept trying to reset them. On top of that, every time there was a crew announcement, the movie selection screen would reset, forcing you to scroll the list of movies all over again. Not that it mattered, as no movies were watchable due to the skipping and stuttering. On this leg, we were served a pasta salad with shrimp. I found a hair in my food, and made the cabin crew aware of this. They responded by offering me a new set of cutlery. When I asked for another pasta salad, the one I received had exactly one shrimp in it. I had the clear feeling that hair in the food would not be reported anywhere. There was no apology from the crew either. I was put on this itinerary by work, but I would never chose Ethiopian airlines for my own money.",2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

Unfortunately, the aircraft they're currently using in the flights to Brazil (B777-200LR) are a little bit old with many problems in the entertainment system: touch screen is awful and some seats don't have any hand control to use it. In despite of that, the flight attendants do a very good job, the meals are good, and the coffee is the best I've ever taken on a flight. We took 4 flights with them and only in the last one, from ADD to GRU, they gave a gift to the kids with some toys to distract them during the long day flight.

Obviously their ticketing office is not open. Long story short they took me round in circles, eventually redirected me to their supervisor who was equally rude and nonchalant, saying I can’t fly to canada through London with a Canadian visit visa!

There was a transfer in Bole International Airport where the transfer was quick and easy to use. There are lots of shops and places to eat at Bole whilst waiting for the next flight. My flight to Mombasa was delayed with limited information from the ground crew. They did know the reason but nothing they could advise customers. That happens sometimes not really an issue as it was only 30 mins. The return journey was somewhat the same apart from leaving Addis Ababa. After multiple checks and buying water for the return journey. The last check point and further baggage check. Water or drinks purchased for the flight were not allowed to be taken on the plane.

Dec,2024.0,I have received nothing but silence,Doha,Johannesburg,"I am appalled by the utter negligence and lack of professionalism displayed by Ethiopian Airlines. My baggage was delayed for five full days during my international trip to Cape Town.

Since then, I have sent multiple follow-up emails (Dec 30, Jan 21, Mar 1, Mar 20), and I have received nothing but silence. Not a single update, not even an apology. How can a supposedly “leading African airline” justify completely ignoring a customer for over four months? This experience has been not only frustrating but also deeply disrespectful. I’ve spent hours chasing a basic response that any responsible airline would’ve handled in days. I have been left with no choice but to escalate this publicly.

Dec,2024.0,service fell painfully short,Washington IAD,Johannesburg,"My recent journey from Washington Dulles (IAD) to Addis Ababa (ADD) on Ethiopian Airlines left much to be desired. Despite the promise of smooth air travel, the service fell painfully short at every stage. Boarding Chaos: The boarding process was an unorganized disaster, dragging on for nearly an hour. No communication, no clear instructions—just utter confusion that could’ve easily been avoided with better planning and staff coordination. Clueless Cabin Crew: Once onboard, I was met with shocking unhelpfulness. A steward noticed there was no room for my bags but simply stared blankly, offering no solution or assistance. I had to figure out on my own to place them under the seat in front of me. The crew’s inability (or unwillingness) to provide basic support was insulting. Unprofessional Behavior: The icing on the cake? A steward reached over my husband—without so much as a word—to grab a duty-free magazine. Not only did she fail to excuse herself, but she didn’t even bother to return the magazine afterward. This lack of courtesy and respect is completely unacceptable on an international flight. Overall, the disorganization, lack of professionalism, and dismissive attitude of the cabin crew made for a truly frustrating experience. Ethiopian Airlines needs to seriously rethink their training and customer service standards. Travelers deserve better.",2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,AirlineQuality

When we boarding, flight attendant sounded annoyed, pointing to which aisle. We got seated and saw a more senior flight attendant sitting till take off. After take off she didn’t do much as well. Safety demonstration was a short video. Crew didn’t bother checking and making sure I was secured. Aircraft was in a relatively poor condition. Bottom of the toilet door was already falling apart, 3 charging ports between us not working, leaning back function of my seat was rough, difficult to get it moving. Even a smoking sign is inverted. Table was dirty and we were seated first row with flight attendant not even asking if we wanted the entertainment. Flight attendant provided close to no service at all. Food was ok, just weird. Flight attendant came over and asked chicken or beef without telling us what was each. So we took a beef and a chicken. What’s funny was the beef was actually lamb. Meat was still ok. But the rice for the beef was hard. The other bread, biscuits, butter and cheese were the usual packaged stuff. Pasta salad tasted weird and chocolate cake was sweet. Towards the end of our flight, flight attendant were busy packing stuff. They even poured juices into the toilet. Prior to landing, flight attendant didn’t do landing checks to make sure things were secured. When we left, no goodbyes or a smile.

Dec,2024.0,Worst airlines ever!!,Cape Town Central,London International,"Ethiopian airways could be the worst airliner I have used. The ground staff was rude and incompetent to an extreme level. I was denied boarding on my return from Cape town to London via Addis Ababa. I was wrongfully denied boarding due to the check-in staff’s lack of knowledge. Despite presenting evidence of my visa status to the UK (accessible online on e-VISA portal and I am a long-term residence), the supervisor refused to review any of my documentation and acted unprofessionally. The supervisor displayed unacceptable behaviour, including dismissiveness and a lack of willingness to verify the requirements. This left me stranded and forced to book an alternative flight with BA at my own expense. BA staff confirmed my online visa statues that I had fulfilled all entry requirements and even suggested Ethiopian Airlines supervisors apologise for their error, but no acknowledgment or apology was made. At that point they did not even offer any flight change or any assistance whatsoever, being it is their error.

She wouldn't allow going to a restroom after the plane had safely landed and the pilot had turned seatbelt signs off because she needed to do a headcount. She wouldn't care if the passanger had medical issues. She wouldn't reset the inflight entertainment service since she claimed to be too busy. A whole row of seats had no service for the over 9-hour flight. She refused to distribut seatbelt extenders for those who needed it until the plane started to take off.

However, despite being a loyal customer and frequent flyer, Ethiopian Airlines has failed to acknowledge or respond to my complaint. This lack of accountability and communication is unacceptable, especially for an airline that prides itself on high standards and quality service. The theft itself is deeply concerning, as it highlights a breach in the airline’s security and handling of passengers’ belongings. I expected my luggage to be treated with care and respect, but this incident has left me feeling let down and frustrated.

Many were forced to hastily unpack their bags at the gate, creating unnecessary chaos and stress. Despite this ordeal, it seemed that nothing substantial changed in terms of process or efficiency. While I understand the airline’s potential motivations—possibly to encourage upgrades to business class or generate additional revenue—the execution felt inconsiderate to passengers. The experience resembled what one might expect from a budget or express airline, which is not the reputation I had associated with Ethiopian Airlines.

No explanation, just a curt ""No space!"" She refused to return it, shoved a tiny tag at me without my details, and dismissed me with zero regard for my belongings or my medication inside. Fast forward to Addis: I ask about my bag. Guess what? ""You should’ve asked in Jeddah."" Excuse me? I’m supposed to teleport my questions back in time?! They then casually tell me my bag will be in Johannesburg. Spoiler alert: It wasn’t. Landed in JNB, and after anxiously waiting for every piece of luggage to be offloaded—my bag is nowhere to be seen. Valuable belongings? Gone. Critical medication? Gone. My patience with both airlines? Completely gone. Ethiopian Airlines and Saudia, this is beyond unacceptable. Mishandling luggage happens, but your rude staff, utter lack of accountability, and zero care for your passengers' well-being are appalling. If your idea of customer service is passing blame and dodging responsibility, congratulations—you nailed it.

They canceled our flight to Johannesburg scheduled for today, December 22nd, and rebooked us on a flight with a 15-hour layover in Ethiopia, meaning we won’t arrive in Johannesburg until December 27th. When contacting their support team, you’re redirected to a call center in another country where no one is able to help or resolve the issue. Since it is incredibly important for us to celebrate Christmas in South Africa, we were willing to purchase a new ticket for today or tomorrow at our own expense. However, their customer service claimed that if we buy a new one-way ticket, we won’t be allowed to use our return flight on January 7th due to their policy requiring passengers to complete both legs of a round trip. Canceling the flight and getting a refund isn’t an option either, as customer service insists that Ethiopian Airlines operates outside the EU and therefore doesn’t have to comply with EU regulations. This is incorrect, as our departure is from Sweden and EU laws should apply. Now, just days before Christmas, we’re left stranded without proper support. On top of that, we’ve already spent money on hotels, accommodations, and domestic flights.

Dec,2024.0,Nightmare Experience with Ethiopian Airlines,Buenos Aires,Kilimanjaro National Park International,"Ethiopian Airlines is the most terrible airline you may encounter in your life. 1. The website is the strangest among all airlines globally. You cannot just change your flight date, you need to send unusual requests and then spend hours talking with their sales representatives via phone, only to have nothing resolved in the end. 2. The payment link they send does not accept credit or debit cards from Europe, the US, Argentina, etc. Instead of solving the problem, they advise you to go to their local office. In the local office, nobody picks up the phones, and the addresses of these local offices seem unclear even to the online representatives. They just put you on hold for 10-15 minutes while they look it up, seemingly by googling. 3. When you fly in Business Class, some interior fixtures are just hanging loose, and the flight attendants try to secure them. 4. I bought Wi-Fi online in advance via the website, but I didn’t receive any access code. The staff on board were also unable to assist me, so I ended up purchasing it twice. A refund? Nobody provides it. 5. At Addis Ababa, you can access the lounge area for 50 USD, but when you ask for a receipt, they say the machine is not working. At the same time, they have a signboard that says, 'PLEASE REPORT IF YOU DO NOT GET A MACHINE RECEIPT.' Hey guys, control yourselves, you strange team. Why are you putting these responsibilities on your clients? Everything about this airline seems messy, from the website to hotline support and local offices (there is no office in the world that has scored more than 2.5 stars).

The lack of accountability, professionalism, and basic customer service in handling this matter is unacceptable. I expected Ethiopian Airlines to value its passengers, but this experience has shown the complete opposite. My multiple attempts to get a clear update have been ignored, and instead of providing a real solution, your representatives have only offered vague and useless responses. Because of your airline’s negligence, I have suffered significant financial loss, stress, and inconvenience. I have been forced to replace essential items at my own expense, and yet Ethiopian Airlines has refused to take responsibility or offer fair compensation.

There were no more flights to Ndola that day so a hotel room was provided at least BUT This hotel room smelt REALLY bad and was very uncomfortable Mum got assisted on to the plane for Ndola the next day and she thought her ordeal with Ethiopian Airlines was a one off Ethiopian Airlines Messed Up Again on her return flight Ndola to Addis Ababa to Zurich via Milan At the Boarding Gate, my mum was REFUSED ENTRY The staff at the gate looked at her boarding pass and read ZURICH and told her she couldn't board the plane because her boarding pass did not have MILAN written on it And on the departure screen it was only written Milan for that flight they told her, so the Ethiopian Airlines staff followed that despite the * FLIGHT NUMBER BEING THE SAME ET736 * BOARDING TIME BEING THE SAME 23.35pm * DEPARTURE TIME BEING THE SAME 00.20am * GATE BEING THE SAME * TERMINAL 2 BEING THE SAME >>>>> AS MILAN How is it difficult to train your staff that this flight is going to several destinations so people going to Milan WILL HAVE A BOARDING PASS WITH MILAN WRITTEN ON IT and people going to Zurich via Milan WILL HAVE ZURICH WRITTEN ON IT, B U T they should ALSO board as it is the SAME PLANE THAT CARRIES ON TO THE FINAL DISTINATION ""ZURICH', after a quick stop dropping off & picking up passengers in Milan They lacked the training that was required to recognise that the system that they use WILL HAVE THE FINAL DISTINATON (ZURICH) WRITTEN ON THE BOARDING PASS DESPITE A FLIGHT GOING VIA ELSEWHERE (MILAN) etc as passengers are required to remain seated on the plane and DO NOT need to check in, get your passport stamped and board again which is why that destination isn't written on the boarding pass MY MUM WAS STRANDED AT ADDIS ABABA BOLE AIRPORT DEPARTURE FOR more than 24 HOIRS FROM around 9.30PM when she arrived from Ndola ON 09 January 2025 to 23.35pm ON 10 JANUARY 2025 when she finally boarded for a flight back to Zurich at 00.20am on 11 January 2025 ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES HAD FINISHED FOR THE NIGHT and just left her there at the gate SCARED AND STRANDED But at least one of them wrote 'CUSTOMER CARE' on her unused boarding pass & told her, ""go to this desk"" Perhaps it was some sort of local joke No one there though!!

I call them to change the flights to the original booking I tried to secure and they tried to charge me a whole £200 more than the price on the website. Customer Service was not helpful in anyway. The return leg was even more of a disaster. At Addis Ababa airport They kept changing the gates for boarding without making announcements which almost resulted in me missing my flight. When I would ask staff about the changes, they would shush me and tell me to go and sit down and wait, so I kept trying to explain to them that the information on my boarding pass did not correspond with any of the flights to the UK that were on the electronic flight information display. Extremely rude members of staff. The final straw and the reason for the review is the food quality as a result of the terrible food served. I got an intense round of food poisoning, which started day after I landed (i barely ate anything the day I landed due to being very busy, the only meal I consumed was shared with someone else and they did not get sick). I have attached a picture of the food below. When I raised a concern about the food, I was shushed and the hostess dumped the food on my tray and walked away.

Feb,2025.0,wouldn't really recomend,Frankfurt,Addis Ababa International,"ahhhhh i hate it so much *i flied from arlanda, then frankfurt to adddis ababa then to somewhere in tanzania* 1st flight. Okay but poor. But they had super loud music that played for so long and it was so annoying. My comments on the looks. Green and bright yellow isn't the best for a plane chair, in my opinion. But what i found strange is the carpet floor in the isle. It had a pattern with christmas wrheats on it? just found that strange. then on ur entertainment screen they would have a terribly made video talking about safety that was just annoying. it was also really long. 2nd flight. Slightly better, like a normal flight. but it also had the annoying safety video and music. 3rd flight: home from zanzibar ( had another airline to zanzibar) to addis ababa. same as the 2nd flight. but now for the 4th flight.. 4th flight home to sweden/arlanda. kind of didnt happen. When it was time to go to the bus that takes u to the plane some error happened. our tickets or whatever it was didnt scan or something (i dont really know because my parents did the work) they put us aside to ""well help wait like 2 minutes"" more than 5 minutes going , no help. the error was that they had given our tickets to someone else like what? and the same thing happened (i think the same thing) had happened to i belive it was 3 people who also were going home to sweden. they put them in the same spot as us. more times goes and no help yet. it had gotten so long and no help. after a while they took us to a flight that goes to paris where other staff. we went on that flight and took a flight from there to sweden. one guy also took the same. and i wonder what happened to another girl that had the same problem because she was going to the usa and then her flight to arlanda was not ""available"" absoulutely terrible airline hate it",2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,TripAdvisor

Feb,2025.0,Is Ethiopian Airlines degrading service level for business class passengers??,Oslo,Zanzibar Island International,"After many trips in Ethiopian Airlines business class between Europe and Africa, we are wondering if it is a new concsious policy to lower the service level for the passengers. It is a well known fact that ET is changing aircraft all the time, but it seems to us that they now have lost control when it comes to taking care of the passengers well being (or maybe simply degraded service level??). On our trip from OSL to ZNZ via ADD, ET changed aircraft several times on 3 of the 4 flights...and consequently we were moved around to various new (not acceptable) seats in the cabin each time. The worst example was when we as a couple were split from seat 2A & 2C to get seats in 2 different areas of the cabin even when our original seats actually were free and only 7 of 30 business class seats were occupied.... Of course we were seated together when we made them aware of the situation, but not in our original seats. ET - THIS IS REALLY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. In contrast to the bad customer service due to (bad) planning, the crew on board were very nice and professional. Food and drinks are generally good, but even here we think the level has degraded over the years. We strongly recommend ET to improve the procedures and take better care of the passengers when aircraft is changed.",4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

It’s been well over that period, and I still haven’t seen a single penny! Their customer service is a complete joke. Every time I call, I’m given the runaround – “Please wait a few more days,” “It’s being processed,” or “We’ll escalate your case.” It’s been weeks, and there’s still no resolution. How hard is it to process a refund? It’s my money, and they’re holding it hostage with no explanation or accountability. To make matters worse, their representatives are rude and dismissive. They don’t seem to care about their customers at all. I’ve spent hours on hold, only to be transferred from one department to another, with no one taking responsibility. It’s clear that Ethiopian Airlines has no respect for their passengers or their hard-earned money. I will never fly with this airline again, and I strongly advise anyone considering booking with them to think twice.

We were informed that there were no vacancies in any hotel in Addis Ababa. When we arrived at the gold lounge, it was FULL, with no place to sit, it was really impossible to stay there for 12 hours, and there was clearly no chance of them calling us to go to the hotel. After more than an hour of waiting, we decided to book a last-minute hotel (we were informed that there were no hotels available in Addis Ababa, but I found several on Booking.com).

I’ve traveled many times with other airlines and never had an issue with lost baggage—until now. While I made it to my destination, my bag did not, and the airline has no idea where it is. I wasted extra time at the airport trying to get answers, but the staff was unhelpful and provided no clear information. Because of this mess, I missed an important meeting, adding even more frustration to an already terrible experience. As of now, I’m still without my luggage and have received no meaningful updates. The lack of accountability and communication from Ethiopian Airlines is unacceptable. I do not recommend them to anyone who values their time, belongings, or sanity.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

Apr,2025.0,Joke of an airline don't waste your time or money,Chicago,Johannesburg International,"My wife and I have been planning this trip to visit her family in South Africa for years and after stressing and saving we finally booked our flights from the US to SA through Ethiopian placing our trust and reliance in them. We have both flown many times both domestically and internationally with a multitude of airlines but our experience with them going out to SA was single handedly the worst experience both of us have ever seen. Our first flight was from Chicago to Addis Ababa was supposed to leave at 10:15AM on 4/9; however due solely to the incompetence and untimeliness the airline this flight was delayed. During the entirety of this delay the gate staff never made any announcements nor did they update the gate signage at any time to indicate or alert to this delay. Whilst in the air my wife asked the flight attendants multiple times about if we would make our connection to Johannesburg from Addis Adaba and there was never once any truthful answers given; instead we were repeatedly told the plane was landing early (it was and did not in any way) and even when landing they still did not clarify for us or anyone else that connecting flights would be missed. Once we deplaned we were directed to the first Ethiopian Airlines desk within sight by airport staff and after the desk staff snatched our original connecting flight boarding passes without even saying as much as a ""Hello"" we were left standing there waiting for them to explain what was going on while witnessing multiple other people from our flight get stuck on rescheduled flights as well without any explanations. Once we finally had our new boarding passes literally thrown at us still without any explanations provided we were left to navigate the Addis Ababa airport for our now 6 hour layover. While we were already stressed, aggravated, and anxious at this point we hoped that from here on out the rest of our trip would run smoothly but sadly the airline again ripped that hope away. We again had to sit at the boarding gate for another extended delay due to their untimeliness and like deja vu the gate staff again made no attempt to be upfront about this delay nor did they update the gate signage which we even witnessed multiple people head over to the desk and could hear them suggesting the gate staff update the sign. When we finally boarded the 6 hour flight we were both amazed that somehow this aircraft did not include any inflight entertainment unless you were one of the lucky few to be sitting in business class. Due to this second delay when we finally landed in Johannesburg it was so late that the entirety of the airport was closing down. Just like when we arrived in Addis the flight crew made no attempt to give directions to people on the flight on where to go to see about missed connections so we were left to navigate the airport alone only stumbling upon an open Ethiopian Airways window by some miracle. The woman at the desk then took our boarding passes again and spent 15 mins tapping away on her computer without explaining what she was doing. Finally, she rescheduled us onto another flight from Joburg to Durban, however as there were no more flights going out that night we were told we would have to take the early morning flight at 6:30am. While you would think with the airport including security closed that the airline would at the very least put us into a nearby hotel for the night until our flight the next morning we were basically told to go find a bench. After a long stressful night where my wife tried her best to sleep while I sat up, unable to sleep because this is Johannesburg, we were finally able to go through security at 5am and wait at the boarding gate. Thank god that unlike not one but both of our previous flights operated directly by Ethiopian Airlines this flight which was SA Airlines not only was on time but boarded and left early. When we finally arrived to our destination in Durban due solely to Ethiopian's lack of competence and timeliness we had already lost our rental car reservation meaning we were out the rental fee we paid, we were unable to find another rental car severely altering the entire trip we had planned, and our 1 day flight ultimately ended a full day later. Now I can understand and accept a delay due to mechanical issues or weather but the fact that both of these flights were delayed simply because they were late is completely unacceptable. Furthermore, the lack of clarity by multiple Ethiopian Airlines staff and the lack of care in not even offering a hotel when their mistakes cost us to miss both connecting flights and have to wait overnight for our last rescheduled flight is utterly astonishing. I reached out to their so called ""Customer Service"" email cause god forbid they have a phone line and they could not even be bothered to respond.

Flight attendants tried to reboot multiple times to no avail. Their suggestion was to move me away 5 rows away from my wife and kids which was never going to happen. I asked for the inflight WiFi so that I could atleast watch something on my phone but was told they’d given the password to all first class passengers, so I had to look at a blank screen for 12 hrs. The toilets on the aircraft were dirty and had holes in them. One of the photo’s posted is the cabinet hanging off. The aircraft was heavily outdated pretty shambolic really especially when you’re having to pay Easter ticket prices for a family of 4. The food that was disturbed to passengers was diabolical well below standard, drinks were flat and warm as there was zero ice on board and that was on my return flight as well.

Apr,2025.0,Flight Review: Ethiopian Airlines ET 412 – A Deeply Disappointing Experience,Cape Town Central,Riyadh International,"My recent experience on Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 412 left much to be desired and has unfortunately led me to reconsider flying with this airline in the future. We boarded the flight at Cape Town International Airport on April 3rd, 2025, with a connection in Addis Ababa en route to Riyadh. As with previous flights on this airline, the connecting time was unreasonably short—just 40 to 50 minutes—which forced us to sprint through customs, remove shoes, and endure an overall stressful transfer process. The ground stewards, instead of offering helpful guidance, were dismissive and arrogant in their approach, making an already chaotic situation worse. Gates kept on changing multiple times while we were sprinting through the airport. Once onboard, the deterioration of the aircraft was impossible to ignore. Seat covers were coming loose, carpets were frayed and lifting from the floor, and even a flickering ceiling light added to the discomfort on a previous flight. It’s hard to believe any proper maintenance is being carried out on these planes. What made the experience unbearable, however, was the overpowering stench in the cabin. I say this with all due respect—it was simply unhygienic and deeply unpleasant. This wasn’t a once-off experience. The odor from domestic workers was consistently present on multiple flights, and it reached a point on this last leg where I couldn't even eat my meal due to the nauseating smell. To make matters worse, the in-flight entertainment screens didn’t function at all, which left passengers with no distraction from the discomfort around them. Ethiopian Airlines urgently needs to improve its customer service, aircraft maintenance, and overall hygiene standards. What could have been a smooth and professional travel experience turned into an ordeal I would not wish on any traveler. ET 412, in particular, was the final straw.",1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
Apr,2025.0,Discrimination on Board: My Worst Airline Experience,Cape Town Central,Addis Ababa Africa,"I am writing to formally express my deep concern and disappointment regarding an incident that occurred on my flight from Cape Town to Addis Ababa on Wednesday, 2nd April 2025. During the flight, I was denied permission to use the bathroom by a cabin crew member who stated that the facility was reserved for business class passengers. However, I observed that other economy class passengers seated nearby were granted access. I felt humiliated and insulted by this unequal treatment, and I believe my ethnicity (Asian) may have been a factor in this discrimination. To make a point, I went to that same bathroom again having seen white passengers queuing and using the toilet. Lo and behold, somehow, the same Flight Attendant notice me and reprimand me again. I informed her of what I noticed and she denied it. I specifically informed her of my observation but instead of empathizing she said to me, “I am serving your food.” Of which I replied, “it’s your job to serve me my food.” This is beyond the context of using the bathroom. When I made her tell a white passenger in the economy after using the business toilet section that it’s only exclusive for business passengers, she directly asked me “Are you happy?”. This is condescending and unprofessional. My experience is true but this FA was unprofessional and clearly needs a customer service training. Having traveled extensively, I have never encountered such discriminatory behavior. I kindly request that Ethiopian Airlines review this incident and take appropriate measures, including providing additional training to your staff, to ensure that all passengers are treated with fairness and respect regardless of their skin color or nationality.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor

May,2025.0,Horrible travel experience,Cape Town Central,Victoria Africa,The food was pretty bad. For instance the beef was fatty and has gristle.The first flight from Cape Town to Addis Ababa was a cattle car operation. Fully booked with rude passengers. The table which comes down from the seat was broken. On our next flight from Addis Ababa to Seychelles we had an older airplane which should be retired. Once again the table was broken. Upon arrival in the Seychelles at 4:00 am we tried to pick up bags. A baggage service came to use and other passengers asked to come over to her counter. She told us our bags ere in Addis Ababa and they will come on the next flight and would be delivered no later 6:00 pm. They never arrived. We asked our hotel to call Airport to find out what happened and they told us there was no there at the airport until the next morning. After contacting the airport they were extremely unhelpful but after a couple of hours they informed us there was bags had been delivered to the wrong hotel. Rather than waiting for them to deliver the bags later in the day we went to the hotel to pick up our bags. Never again will I fly this airline. Luckily our return flight to the US is on Qatar Airline which offers outstanding service.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,TripAdvisor
May,2025.0,They don’t accept their own currency it’s almost laughable imagine New York airport asking for birr only not dollars,Chicago,Addis Ababa International,They will try to make you pay for another flight or fee especially if you are American or European worse you have to pay either in dollars or euros they don’t take their own money and the only way you can get dollars legally is the commercial bank of Ethiopia the bank is clearly a fraud it’s not a bank I waited for 6 hours to get 200…. They don’t like giving dollars but love to get dollar after 6hours they told me they are closing this is not only me this happened to a lot of people I know in the states and I don’t blame them for not ever going back there what type of nation asks for dollars and refuses to accept their own currency it’s a disgrace not a nation that respects its currency you have pay in dollars he said while refusing to accept their own it’s their policy… $$$ it’s disgusting and disrespectful to their customers and their nation they don’t get it that when you stay there even if someone sent you money you only get it in their currency it’s a scam it’s not international they just want quick money it’s a organized mafia,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,TripAdvisor
May,2025.0,WHAT A HORRIBLE AIRLINE,Amman,Nairobi International,Ethiopian airlines will close their gates very early in less busy airports. Quite unfortunate that i still missed my flight 1hr 30 mins before the actual plane time. They asked me to pay for the penalty which i did for me to be able to be in a night flight. Their negligence turned out to be my responsibility. A dirty mediocre airline. The maintenance of their planes and attitude from staff is COMPLETELY HORRENDOUS. I will never ever travel on ethiopian airlines again.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,TripAdvisor
May,2025.0,Call Centre is 💯👌,Jeddah,Johannesburg International,"I had an issue with my visa and needed to delay my flight, and I was honestly amazed by the level of service I received from Ethiopian Airlines' call centre. The staff were incredibly patient, helpful, and understanding throughout the entire process. They took the time to listen, explained my options clearly, and made a stressful situation feel much more manageable. It's rare to find such kind and efficient customer support these days. Thank you, Ethiopian Airlines, for going above and beyond!",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,TripAdvisor
